1
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,526
I'm very susceptible to location

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,446
and to artifacts.

3
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,742
When I started films as a young man,

4
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,579
I could, say, see a ruined
sort of building or something

5
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,748
and imagine all kinds of things
happening in it.

6
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,085
I could think of little films to make in it.

7
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:48,257
And it itself would contain a story in a way,
like a mystery.

8
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,343
So when I first walked
into the hall at St. Andrew's,

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,512
in fact many of their rooms there,

10
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,100
I was, you know, provoked
and stimulated by them

11
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,395
and was thinking of which scenes
I could stage where.

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,606
You know, the mood that was there.

13
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,110
And the feeling, I think, left
from all of the energies and emotions

14
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,905
of young people passing
through the school,

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,283
you know, during its lifetime

16
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,410
were palpable.

17
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,871
And then I like props. You know,
I like the bagpipes being assembled.

18
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,916
You know, it's like sort of equipment
that's tactile.

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,544
You know, these are precious artifacts
of the school.

20
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,922
Sacred things, you know,
the candle, the banners.

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,924
You know, this is ritual.

22
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,678
So I thought that this was
the way to begin the film,

23
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,472
was really to take the audience
in a way

24
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,268
through what I had experienced
in visiting the school.

25
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,563
And what I experienced
all those years ago as a young man

26
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,192
in Bellevue Hill in Sydney going
from my first day to the Scots College

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,738
where... You know, I wish we could smell
the things you smell.

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,323
The smell of oiled wood.

29
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,909
The smell of old leather,
and dust and books and...

30
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,829
These are memories deeply rooted in us
from our school days.

31
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,291
I mean, everybody's school days
is something,

32
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,045
whether it was good, bad
or plain boring, you know?

33
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,840
It's very powerfully imprinted upon you
because it was-

34
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,927
You know, you left home
and left Mom or Dad, or both.

35
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,638
Then you walked through the doors
to what, you don't know.

36
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,142
And how will you go? How will you be?
It's a mystery.

37
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:27,689
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, boys,
the light of knowledge.</i>

38
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,617
<i>I'm Tom Schulman.
I wrote Dead Poets Society.</i>

39
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,747
I went to a place called Montgomery Bell
Academy for high school,

40
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,709
and I think it was gentleman,
scholar, athlete, Christian.

41
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,669
That was the-

42
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,046
And I wasn't a Christian

43
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,132
so I was gonna miss on that score
right away.

44
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,513
And there was that constant
sort of drumming of those values

45
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,767
into our daily, you know, education.

46
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:08,522
<i>Tradition, honor,
discipline, excellence.</i>

47
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,235
You could take them
seriously or not, but most people did, so...

48
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,903
And if you didn't, you'd get demerits,

49
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,239
and it was that kind of environment.

50
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,951
I didn't go to a boarding school,

51
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,620
but a lot of people
who worked on this movie,

52
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,831
Peter Weir, Robin Williams did.

53
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,501
So they brought
some of their boarding school experiences

54
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,962
to the movie in various ways.

55
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,297
The school I went to
was an all-boys school

56
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,925
that sort of wished
it could be a boarding school.

57
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,470
So I knew, you know,
that we got our lectures

58
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,015
about what the school should be like

59
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,477
if it could have been
the way they wanted it to be, so...

60
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,521
But I was in high school
in the late '60s

61
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,649
so, you know, the cat was sort of
out of the bag in terms of tradition.

62
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,362
But I certainly understood
the constriction of tradition.

63
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,989
You know, the notion

64
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,534
that if we have to do things
the way we've always done them

65
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,953
simply because
that's the way we do them.

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,791
I think as a kid, I felt very- Or as a boy,
I felt very suffocated by that notion

67
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,961
and was glad to see
the '60s rebellion take place.

68
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,340
But given that that was an essential part
of the movie too...

69
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,593
I mean, it's the essential background
of the piece,

70
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,802
that these boys are-

71
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,680
They start out in a place
with the four pillars.

72
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,975
Tradition, honor,
those kinds of things,

73
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:32,606
which are admirable things but
there can be too much of anything, so...

74
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,702
<i>I'm glad you could come by.</i>

75
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,122
<i>- Thrilling ceremony as usual, Dr. Nolan.
- You've been away too long.</i>

76
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,375
I'd never- I'm not one really for nostalgia

77
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,837
and I'd never thought back
to my school days with fondness

78
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,966
or written some kind of a memoir
or referred to it in any way really. It was-

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,136
As soon as the gates were open
in the last year, I ran out of there.

80
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,888
I was glad to get out of there.

81
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:10,268
But here was the story of school
and a school in the past.

82
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,812
So the first thing I did,
it didn't bother Tom Schulman,

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,941
was to just adjust it a few years.

84
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,486
Just earlier, at the end
of the Eisenhower period.

85
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,365
And also the period
in which I was at school.

86
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:29,496
So I could easily contact the age group
through my memory.

87
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,331
And so I thought of my friends
at school.

88
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:36,795
I thought of Alex and I thought of Costa
and Mel, you know, and Willy Williams.

89
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,713
So I could put these people together

90
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,715
and imagine
if we were in this circumstance,

91
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,051
because we were
at a very similar school.

92
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,387
The Scots College at Bellevue Hill

93
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,683
which had dayboys, which I was,
and boarders.

94
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,435
You know, very, very strict-

95
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,064
You know, canings,
which you call paddling, and...

96
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,150
I was always getting into trouble there,
you know, and getting whacked,

97
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,654
and, you know,
sort of very much that feeling of-

98
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:09,703
<i>Like, our motto was:
Utinam Patribus Nostris Digni Simus.</i>

99
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,747
"May we be worthy of our forefathers, "

100
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,750
which we always used to laugh about,
you know?

101
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:21,631
But that was the atmosphere,
so I could really plug back into it.

102
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,301
And to a degree,

103
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,678
draw on it.

104
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,971
<i> you did summer school.</i>

105
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,850
<i>Yep. Chemistry.
My father thought I should get ahead.</i>

106
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,061
<i>- How was your summer, Slick?
- Keen.</i>

107
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,067
<i>- Meeks, door, closed.
- Yes, sir.</i>

108
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,486
<i>Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?</i>

109
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:48,450
<i>Travesty, horror,
decadence, excrement.</i>

110
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,659
I'm John Seale

111
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,663
<i>and I was the director of photography
on Dead Poets Society.</i>

112
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,418
It was a project that Peter loved dearly
when he read it.

113
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,757
There was no- There was no way
that he was in any way

114
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,345
not very excited about almost everything
that happened in it.

115
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,184
So that I found in Peter at that stage

116
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:19,147
was most exciting for me as well,
because everything we talked of,

117
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,192
he was, like, really fired up on it.

118
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:28,657
It... He related to the kids in the film
and their characters.

119
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:34,412
Particularly
Tommy Leonard's character.

120
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,291
Even... You know,
even though in that character, the...

121
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,336
His demise towards the end
is very sad in the film,

122
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,256
but he related to his character
with his father relationship.

123
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,010
And he was so excited about all of that

124
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,889
that, you know,
he hated not shooting on Sundays,

125
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,684
which worried us.

126
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,936
Six days is enough, thanks.

127
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,106
But that's how excited he was
about the film.

128
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,859
So the preproduction into it
was a very...

129
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:11,157
Much more in-depth in a way
of the script.

130
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,201
It's hard to explain that,

131
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:17,455
but he really went into the script
very deeply.

132
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,837
<i>- Don't ever dispute me in public.
- Father, I wasn't...</i>

133
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,464
<i>After you've finished medical school
and you're on your own,</i>

134
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,051
<i>then you can do as you damn well please,
but until then, you do as I tell you.</i>

135
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,346
<i>- That clear?
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry.</i>

136
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,017
<i>Ahem. You know how much this means
to your mother, don't you?</i>

137
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,644
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

138
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,647
<i>You know me,
always taking on too much.</i>

139
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:47,318
I think I really worked
pretty much from intuition

140
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:52,240
in terms of sort of things
outside the actual craft of what I'm doing.

141
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,784
I fundamentally think filmmaking
is a craft.

142
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,245
Film directing.

143
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,416
And just a few individuals are just
a cut above the craft, you know,

144
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,878
or every now and again
are inspired in one way or another.

145
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,298
But then can slump back down in.
No one's brilliant all the time.

146
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,885
I mean, a few freaks of nature
like Mozart or someone.

147
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,513
You know,
even Shakespeare wrote bad plays.

148
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,392
Therefore, you're concentrating
on your craft a lot- Most of the time.

149
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,937
You know, how to get the scene right,
you know, and how to craft it.

150
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,147
It's all conscious.

151
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,691
Good writing, you know, and so forth.

152
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,319
Then there's the other.

153
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,447
There's the other mysterious side,
the unconscious side.

154
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,283
The "I don't know why,
but I think you should do this, " you know?

155
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,286
"Let's go outside.
Let's not do this scene in here. "

156
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,664
Things that become inspirations
so that people remember.

157
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,750
Things that become critical to the film.

158
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,461
And if there's enough of them,
that can, you know,

159
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,506
then jolt the whole thing up
another level.

160
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,177
Small things like the birds.
You know, I filmed those clouds of birds

161
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,970
because they were just there every day.

162
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,847
I used to say,
"What are those birds doing?"

163
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,308
They'd say, "That's the crop.
We've just picked the crop. "

164
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,894
You couldn't look at them
without thinking about it.

165
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,104
What makes them turn when they turn?
You know?

166
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,774
Is there a leader?
Is there a sound, a signal?

167
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,734
You know, so you shoot it.
You sort of think

168
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,362
it's rather like a bunch of these young kids
running around.

169
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,989
You know, they're there at the moment.

170
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,201
Not found their individuality,
like the birds there.

171
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,286
They're just- It's kind of a metaphor.

172
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,372
And then I think,
"Maybe it'll be too obvious. "

173
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,541
And I think,
"Well, we'll see in the cutting room. "

174
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,253
<i>- three laboratory experiments
from the project list</i>

175
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,132
<i>and report on them every five weeks.</i>

176
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,009
We tried very hard not to create

177
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,178
an "evil teachers versus good students"

178
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,347
sort of world.

179
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,058
We tried to set up the parents
and the teachers

180
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,726
and the administration of the school

181
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,479
as people
who were simply doing their jobs

182
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,439
in the way they believe
they should be done,

183
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,485
and parents who were raising their kids
the way it was done at the time

184
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,321
and the way that they believed
it should be done.

185
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,699
So they were true to what it was like then,
you know?

186
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,493
At least that was...
That's my impression of it.

187
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,205
Because I look at them and think,
"Yeah, that's the way it was, " you know?

188
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,832
Nowadays, we look at those people

189
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,460
as though they have some sort of
ulterior motive.

190
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,962
But in fact they were just doing

191
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,631
what they knew how to do best,
you know,

192
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,510
and were teaching and educating
the way they believed it should be done.

193
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:26,561
This scene, as I recall, originally-

194
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,938
In the original script...
And we shot it, we tried it.

195
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,525
- Keating walked into class
and immediately jumped up on his desk,

196
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,695
and started with some of the-

197
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,197
His dialogue
that's now in the trophy room scene.

198
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,326
And it didn't seem to work.

199
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:46,164
It was too much. He was kind of
coming too hard at the boys.

200
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,541
So we came up with this idea

201
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,919
that he would just simply walk in
and walk out,

202
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,712
and there would be more mystery
that way

203
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,964
and they would follow him
to the trophy room.

204
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,634
<i>Well, come on.</i>

205
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,430
Tom Schulman's script
was extremely good.

206
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,100
And Peter, like any good director,

207
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,772
would always try to improve it,
has to be the word.

208
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:15,443
And by doing that we would go
through very carefully every scene

209
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,528
and where it's at in the film.

210
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,366
Should it be there?
Or should it be a little earlier?

211
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:26,621
Would it explain certain things better
if the scene was placed a little earlier

212
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,625
or even a little later than where Tom
had placed it in the script?

213
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,674
Very in-depth, like, in dissecting
all of the characters and the scenes

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,009
to make them all fit and flow,

215
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:45,807
and to make everything work
towards the end result of the film.

216
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,059
<i>Not a clue?</i>

217
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,436
I often say to writers that, you know,

218
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,356
I sort of have to consume the script
in some way

219
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,024
and make it part of my sensibility.

220
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,487
It has to become organic to me
in a way.

221
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:05,368
But that's not to take the shine off
what the writer has done,

222
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,663
<i>like as Tom has done with Dead Poets.</i>

223
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,957
It was just damn good writing.

224
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,919
So I think probably what I did
was to edit it somewhat.

225
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,588
And the tone changes then are really

226
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,925
to do only with casting,

227
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,678
which is pretty impactful.

228
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,473
<i>Now,</i>

229
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,561
<i>Mr. Pitts.</i>

230
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,147
Casting's so important.

231
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,026
You know, I think after the concept
or the idea comes casting.

232
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,863
Then comes script, if you're doing
some sort of order of importance,

233
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,825
which is why some people's first films
can be very rough in the script

234
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,412
but if the idea is strong or truthful
and the casting's right,

235
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,623
you know, they'll get a long way with it.

236
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:58,212
So casting, I love it.
It's exhausting but I do adore it.

237
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,174
Sometimes I think of myself
more like a detective

238
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,718
who's looking for a missing person.

239
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,597
The missing person could be any one
of these people coming in here.

240
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,932
Disguised as it were, you know?

241
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:15,396
So I'm looking for the character
of John Finch, you know, or somebody.

242
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,649
You're looking
for whatever the character is

243
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,904
and in come a range of people
claiming to be this person.

244
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,406
So as the detective,

245
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,660
I have to thoroughly, you know,
use my intuition and my experience

246
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:34,415
to work out who is really the person
out of these impostors.

247
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,626
<i>No. Ding.</i>

248
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,003
<i>Thanks for playing anyway.</i>

249
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,467
<i>Because we are food for worms, lads.</i>

250
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,096
<i>Because, believe it or not,
each and every one of us in this room...</i>

251
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,890
I'm very fond of this scene in the hall.

252
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,811
I like how everybody did it.

253
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,188
I don't seem to remember
doing anything.

254
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,440
I remember being there.

255
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,777
But it just-

256
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,613
Everything came together
in the right way for that scene.

257
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,117
The photographs for example,
which were all, you know, obviously real,

258
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,035
that are in the cases.

259
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,870
They seem to me to be-

260
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,288
For every one of our boys,

261
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,876
a face in the photographs
that was almost identical.

262
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
That was sheerly by chance.

263
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,800
But, you know, I can... I can see Neil,
I can certainly see Todd in there.

264
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,887
And so I think Robin, who I think
the kind of quality of his voice there

265
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,682
was just right.

266
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:39,814
The shading and modulation of his voice
is very effective.

267
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,984
Because he's not playing
on obvious emotions. He's not-

268
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:46,028
You know, the boys
wouldn't accept it anyway if he was.

269
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:51,659
He's sort of really a rather good storyteller
or a mood-invoker in that scene.

270
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,580
He gets you in, in other words.
Well, you know.

271
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,417
All except one.

272
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,336
And we need always the one
who doesn't get taken in by it,

273
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,297
and thinks he's pretty much a weirdo.

274
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,512
It helped, I think, create a certain magic
to the moment

275
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,598
where they're looking
at those old photographs.

276
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,853
And there are those boys whispering,
you know, back to him, "Carpe diem. "

277
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,856
That just to me created a certain magic.

278
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,526
But this scene
was actually suggested to me

279
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,196
by my next-door neighbor
when I was 12 years old.

280
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,780
I had a...

281
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,282
My next-door neighbor was a guy

282
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,410
who was about three or four years
older than me named Jerry Small, and-

283
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,329
Great guy who when-

284
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,290
We had a brand-new high school
at the time.

285
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,918
And he mentioned to me

286
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,253
that one of the biggest problems
with the high school

287
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,257
was that you wouldn't get trophy cases
with all the pictures and the trophies

288
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,593
because it was a new school
and it had no history.

289
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,637
And then I think he mentioned to me,

290
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,431
he said, "Have you ever looked
at those pictures of those old...?

291
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,184
Old pictures. Those people staring at you,
they're all dead.

292
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,810
They're dead. " You know?

293
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,771
And that always stuck with me,

294
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:07,109
and that's where this idea, you know,
sort of wove itself into this scene.

295
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,737
<i>- What?
- I can't make it, guys.</i>

296
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,657
<i>I have to have dinner
at the Danburrys' house tonight.</i>

297
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,867
Is there anything worse
than a period film...?

298
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,079
You know, say, you're in this 15th century
and some character goes-

299
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:23,209
You know, sort of shampooed hair,
sort of flicks, you know.

300
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,877
I wanted to get their hair cut first.

301
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,505
Like the Army, you know?
Big difference to get a haircut.

302
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,759
Haircuts early
and wear their uniforms around quite a bit

303
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:36,222
and forbidden slang words,
forbidden expressions, you know?

304
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,685
You couldn't say, you know,
"Whatever. It's cool" or "Wow"

305
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:46,148
or, "Hey, man, " you know, "Shit, "
or anything like that. All banned words.

306
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,069
And then I had researched on which
of the words that were around at the time.

307
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,281
You know, "keeno," I remember
we discovered and something else.

308
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:58,035
You know, so there was a list of words
that were slang at the time.

309
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,830
And I said, "Above all, you know,
try to, you know,

310
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,167
get into the way of a certain... "
It's awful to say.

311
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,670
"A certain innocence that's gone.

312
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:12,258
A certain lack of complexity
in young people. "

313
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,553
There wasn't as much- There were good
and bad people, I'm not saying that.

314
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,681
But there wasn't as much
sort of complexity in communication,

315
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,392
or there were no drugs, you know?

316
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,477
So you more fully expressed yourself.

317
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,523
"I don't want anyone, " I said, "to leave
their sentence unfinished like today. "

318
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,776
Like today you can say,
"Oh, man, you know-

319
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,611
Wow, I saw this movie it was-

320
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,324
You know, I mean...
You know, I'm... Wow. "

321
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,284
You know,
so they didn't do that in 1959.

322
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,328
They'd say, "I saw this film last night.

323
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,664
This picture, well, it was really great,
you know?

324
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,667
It was... It's... Cary Grant's in it.

325
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,296
You gotta go and see it. It's wonderful.
I'll go with you again if you wanna go. "

326
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,550
Full sentences
and full, expressed meanings.

327
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,095
And it was all in the spirit of fun,
but it did begin to take effect.

328
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,723
I said, "Try and construct back-stories
with each other. "

329
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,059
I think I said, "Talk to each other about,
you know,

330
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,144
you've been at the school
this period of time. "

331
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,437
Logical things these were,

332
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,315
but, you know,
we had the time to do it over there.

333
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,318
Then I think we had a couple of days
of classrooms

334
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,904
in which I was... Played a teacher.

335
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,031
And I was an English teacher.

336
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,534
I thought it was like a way
of deconstructing my own

337
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,413
position as director to relax everything.

338
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,248
I called myself Mr. Quern.

339
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,293
And I told them
they had to report in uniform

340
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:34,757
in one of the rehearsal-type spaces.
You know, at 3 p. m. We had desks set up.

341
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,426
Just the key boys.

342
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,387
They came in
and I said, "Okay, sit down. "

343
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,430
I called them their character names.

344
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:46,936
And I said, "I'm Mr. Quern.
I'm your English teacher this term.

345
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:53,484
As you know, one of our first priorities
will be to organize the school play.

346
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:57,947
To which extent, I'm thinking we should
do something original. Any ideas?"

347
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,951
You know,
so they could then react in character.

348
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,328
To a teacher that's not in the script,
you know,

349
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,081
so it wouldn't ruin any of their things.

350
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:10,042
And I made a fool of myself.
I became an actor myself.

351
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,713
And, you know, I don't say bonded,
I'm sick of that word.

352
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,049
But we just had a good time together

353
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,970
and fun together. And they could explore
their characters a bit.

354
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,807
And we did invent a sort of school play.
And I spoke to them quite seriously,

355
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,978
so if they'd start to giggle, you know,
I'd say, "It's not a laughing matter. "

356
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,564
Then it'd be a strange metaphor.
"We've got a job to do.

357
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,899
Do you understand what I'm saying,
Neil?

358
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,027
Now, let's keep the laughter
for after-hours, all right?

359
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:41,031
We've got a play to produce
and we've gotta get on with it. "

360
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,660
You know, at the same time being a kind
of a jerk. It's quite complicated.

361
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:49,790
But it became a sort of... I don't know,
a sort of preliminary story.

362
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,168
We lived that little life

363
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,963
and so by the time we get onto the set
for the first day of shooting,

364
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,716
I'm not the director
but I'm also Mr. Quern.

365
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,343
You know, that's a secret
that they share, you know.

366
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,430
I don't mean
I kept the Mr. Quern thing going,

367
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,516
but everything was alive and crackling.

368
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,978
<i>Mr. Perry, will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface,</i>

369
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,272
<i>entitled "Understanding Poetry"?</i>

370
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:19,487
<i>"Understanding Poetry,
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph. D.</i>

371
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,988
<i>To fully understand poetry,</i>

372
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:25,284
<i>we must first be fluent with its meter,
rhyme and figures of speech,</i>

373
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,869
<i>then ask two questions.</i>

374
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,663
<i>One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?</i>

375
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,333
<i>And two:
How important is that objective?</i>

376
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,960
<i>Question one rates
the poem's perfection.</i>

377
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,129
<i>Question two rates its importance.</i>

378
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,507
<i>And once these questions
have been answered,</i>

379
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,302
<i>determining the poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.</i>

380
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,057
<i>If the poem's score for perfection
is plotted on the horizontal of a graph,</i>

381
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,309
<i>and its importance
is plotted on the vertical... "</i>

382
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,939
Oddly enough, the draft
that I circulated was the first draft.

383
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,733
It's very rare that I do that. But this...

384
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,114
Most scripts, I'll write 25 or 30- You know,
25 or 30 sets of revisions anyway.

385
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,242
But this one,
I read it over again and again

386
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,329
and I thought- You know, making
little changes but nothing major, so...

387
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,165
But after that,
because we went through two directors,

388
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,292
there were all kinds of little things,
you know?

389
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,253
<i> yielding a massive total area...</i>

390
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,879
When Peter came on, he said,

391
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,756
"Go back to the original
and work off that. "

392
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:25,344
So... And then it was really that
that kind of...

393
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,679
And then there were-

394
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,558
I think there were three sets
of revisions before shooting.

395
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,896
And in fact,
we only read the script aloud once,

396
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:40,609
the night before we started shooting.
He had a little read-around with the boys.

397
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,444
And...

398
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,364
Which... And no rehearsals
that I can remember.

399
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,617
Peter liked to basically
shoot the rehearsal, and...

400
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,329
You know,
I remember after the read-around,

401
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,748
I went back in my room
and just wrote all night,

402
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,166
making all kinds of changes.

403
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,919
And without even Peter saying anything,
I just...

404
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,921
I came back and he said,
"What have you done?"

405
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,924
I said, "I've made all these... "
He said, "Why'd you do all that?"

406
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,803
I said, "It's not working. " He's going,
"Oh, don't be ridiculous. It's working. "

407
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,349
Because I don't think I was quite aware
of how to deal with the first reading

408
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,978
and that low level of, you know, energy.

409
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,814
Yeah, that the actors are putting in, so-

410
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,150
Or not putting in, and rightfully so.

411
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,862
You don't want them jumping into their
characters, you know, on the first reading.

412
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,324
It's something they kind of build into.

413
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,035
It's not the Stanislavsky way anyway.

414
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,330
The Method says read it flat.

415
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,833
Let yourself
sort of be filled with the character.

416
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,668
Don't invest the character.

417
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,087
Use the reading
and all the early rehearsals

418
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,673
as a time of exploration.

419
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,093
Let the material work on you.
Don't work on the material.

420
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,638
<i>Rip, rip, rip.</i>

421
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,972
<i>Rip it out. Rip.</i>

422
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,185
<i>Rip, rip.</i>

423
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,980
<i>Yeah.</i>

424
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,024
<i>Rip it out.</i>

425
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,529
<i>What the hell is going on here?</i>

426
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,115
<i>I don't hear enough rips.</i>

427
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,202
<i>- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. McAllister.</i>

428
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,704
I went to university.
You can see me wriggling.

429
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,583
You know, I'm wriggling like this
because I'm thinking, "University. "

430
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,963
You know, I was a real burnout.
You know, I was gone in a year and a bit.

431
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,925
And I'm sure they said good riddance,
you know?

432
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,177
Which is what I said about them,
you know? But I...

433
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,762
I was doing an arts course there.

434
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,517
Once, I had this bad experience
with a poem. It was a Blake poem.

435
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:40,688
And we'd been asked to read it
for the tutorial.

436
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:44,233
And to come in
with something prepared on it.

437
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,527
And so it was-

438
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:47,778
I can't remember the poem.

439
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,239
Maybe it was "The Rose" of Blake's.
I can't remember.

440
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,825
But I do remember everything else.
I remember sitting down.

441
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,368
I was maybe 15 or so.

442
00:24:54,535 --> 00:25:00,457
At Sydney University, I was 18, 19.
And I had loved this poem.

443
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,837
I had just... It filled me. I just loved it.
Maybe four verses.

444
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,215
So the lecturer down the front
in the right lecture theater

445
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,550
wrote it in the blackboard.

446
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:13,595
And I can still hear this chalk squeaking,
you know, as he wrote out the poem.

447
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,764
Then he sort of dusted his hands off

448
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:20,978
and turned to us and said,
"Now, this is an inferior poem of Blake's.

449
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,148
Why is it inferior? Let's take a look.

450
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,983
And then we'll hear from you, "
you know?

451
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,529
I began to blush, you know,
because I thought it was so good.

452
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,491
And he then pointed out, you know,
sort of rather poor sort of structure

453
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,579
and, you know,
whatever metaphor was rather obvious.

454
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,832
Banality of its sentiment.

455
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,500
And I looked around at everybody else

456
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,336
who was writing all of this down,
you know?

457
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:51,508
And I was beet red by this time...
Not that anyone could see me.

458
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,262
- with embarrassment
at my love of the poem.

459
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,390
And that I must be a fool, you know?

460
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,894
And so I left that lecture
and never went back, really.

461
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,939
I just... I never read poetry.
I didn't read poetry for,

462
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,651
I don't know,
maybe till this script came to me.

463
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,279
It'd almost make me nauseous,
you know, to read it.

464
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,156
So that's how bad education can be.

465
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,909
A lot of people
should leave school earlier.

466
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,411
I think it'd probably be better
to get into a trade.

467
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,288
Make shoes or something.

468
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,166
You know, something good like that.
Cook, go to restaurants.

469
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:29,046
You know, make a different kind of life
based on craft.

470
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,507
I think there's a lot of unhappy people
in college,

471
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,218
who feel that their mom and dad
want you to go there

472
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,346
and that's what you gotta do.
Everybody does it, you know.

473
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,849
Couldn't really care. Just get a grade.

474
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,311
You know? I mean,
I don't really think we're educated

475
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,524
in the way that I think of education
or came to realize education,

476
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,443
you know, could be.
You know, when you read about it,

477
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,780
really kind of my ideal would be,
I suppose,

478
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,075
to have, you know,
gone through the English system

479
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,745
as it was in the late 19th century
or something.

480
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,165
You know, to read history,
as they say.

481
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,626
I think you got a...
You get a good smattering at school.

482
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,878
I think we tend to turn it
into a kind of religion.

483
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,296
You know, it's a—

484
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,382
Or a means to an end, which is—

485
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,971
It's sad in one way. I mean, it's really,
you know, not just-

486
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,598
You know, something
you do in order that you get a good job,

487
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,435
to get a lot of money to go on holiday,
you know, in Florida.

488
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:30,357
You know, I mean, if that's all the reason,
I'll just keep dancing, you know?

489
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,988
The joy of education is surely
to give you the tools to communicate,

490
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,366
to handle yourself in the world
and to read on.

491
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,871
Read on, you know.
So that you go into your life

492
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,039
and you can,
with all your troubles, you know,

493
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,376
whatever is bothering you
in the world or personally...

494
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:52,337
You can take a book,
and as they say,

495
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,964
curl up with it, you know?

496
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,134
I don't think there's anything
quite like it for-

497
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:01,096
There is— Of course, any of the arts
do that. You know, they give you a—

498
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,183
You know, take you out of yourself
and it can be anywhere from ecstasy.

499
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,811
You know, as a way to— To simply

500
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,814
engaging your intellect or emotion.

501

<i>Captain of the soccer team,</i>

502
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,985
<i>editor of the school annual,
Cambridge bound,</i>

503

505

<i>Thigh man. Mr. К was a hell-raiser.</i>

506
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,457
<i>- What's the Dead Poets Society?
- Is there a picture?</i>

507
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:33,712
<i>- Nothing, no other mention of it.
- That boy there, see me after lunch.</i>

<i>Mr. Keating.</i>

<i>Sir?</i>

<i>Say something.</i>

00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,059
<i>О Captain, My Captain?</i>

513
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:48,977
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

514
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,357
<i>We were just looking in your old annual.</i>

515
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,692
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

516
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,362
<i>No, that's not me.</i>

517
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,199
<i>Stanley "The Tool" Wilson.</i>

518
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,951
You know, that film was shot

519
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,704
before the innovation of monitors
on the set.

520
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,000
So it was shot in what I think
I can call the old-fashioned way

521
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,629
where the director would talk
to the operator or the DP

522
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,091
and I was doing both there,

523
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,926
which I love doing with Peter, of course.

524
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,805
And, you know, a lot of the preproduction
we did have certain shots

525
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:30,560
and certain movements of the camera
predetermined,

526
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,439
but a lot of the time it was what we used
to call the "what if" system.

527
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,650
What if we do that? What if we do this?

528
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:40,028
Which is all part of simply being ready

529
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,616
to convert to whatever the situation
will give us or the actor would give us.

530
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:49,329
And I remember one was a long-
A particularly long dolly

531
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:55,419
was the one that we set up
where the boys walk out to see Keating.

532
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,462
And then they run back in excitement.

533
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,383
And I remembered as the operator,

534
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,302
the value of reading,
and in fact learning, the script

535
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,097
because the light was failing.

536
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,308
And I remember being very angst
about that, that we're losing the light.

537
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,146
We didn't wanna come back the next day.
We had a schedule. And Peter said:

538
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,815
"I want the boys to really run back.
They're excited.

539
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,735
Now they're gonna run back
and start the Dead Poets Society

540
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,695
and go to the cave and-"

541
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,197
But they were throwing lines as they ran

542
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:28,493
and the dolly's rattling away
and three or four guys pulling it.

543
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,455
And I remembered thinking, you know,

544
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,834
that I've only got a couple of takes of this
and then the light'll be gone.

545
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:41,465
And the value of reading the script deeply
enough to almost learn the lines

546
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,593
meant that I could anticipate
who was gonna talk next.

547
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,054
And I was able to whip pan to them.

548
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,473
Get their line, then whip pan
to the next guy.

549
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,349
And we got it.

550
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,394
And I think that was, you know,

551
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:58,565
like an instance of, you know,
this speed we have to maintain.

552
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,234
But the weather,
you know, the night falling

553
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,987
simply meant that it tightened
the noose on us

554
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,782
to get it right the first time
or the second time.

555
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,117
<i>Move.</i>

556
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,161
<i>- Me too.
-1 don't know, Neil.</i>

557
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,579
<i>What? Pitts.</i>

558
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,623
<i>- Pittsie, come on.
- His grades are hurting.</i>

559
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,626
<i>- You can help him, Meeks.
- What is this, a midnight study group?</i>

560
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,128
<i>Forget it, you're coming.
Meeks, your grades hurting too?</i>

561
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,631
<i>- I'll try anything once.
- Except sex.</i>

562
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,133
<i>I'm in as long as we're careful.</i>

563
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,594
<i>- What about you, Knox?
- I don't know, Charlie.</i>

564
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,846
<i>Come on, Knox. It'll help you get Chris.</i>

565
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,099
<i>Yeah? How?</i>

566
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,644
<i>- Women swoon. Ha, ha, ha.
- But why do they swoon?</i>

567
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,272
<i>Charlie, tell me why they swoon.
Charlie.</i>

568
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,691
<i>You're not listening.</i>

569
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,277
<i>Look, you follow the stream
to the waterfall.</i>

570
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,071
<i>It's right there. It's gotta be like-</i>

571
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,199
I grew up
in the mythological South, you know?

572
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,826
I grew up in the real South.

573
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,494
And there were a lot of little secret

574
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,455
and not so secret societies in the South
when I grew up there.

575
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,209
Every high school would have three
or four or five fraternities and sororities.

576
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,877
Some of them were citywide.

577
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,046
Some of them,
as far as I know, were national.

578
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,007
So there were these clubs
that you were either in or out of,

579
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:10,095
and all that sort of thing going on, but-

580
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,348
So sort of being a part of it, you know,

581
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:18,603
conforming, being cool
was very important, you know.

582
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,150
And how that plays into
the Dead Poets Society,

583
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,152
to that club that they formed,
I don't know.

584
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,820
I mean, I remember, you know,

585
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,989
my parents will probably
be shocked to know,

586
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:33,660
but most of what I did in high school
involved sneaking out,

587
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,912
you know, at night, after-hours.

588
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,874
After, you know-
If you had to get home at 11:00,

589
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,085
you were home at 11, your parents
saw you go to bed, they went to sleep.

590
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,046
You went out some window
and somebody picked you up

591
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,425
and you know, you were out
on some dead-end doing something.

592
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:54,681
So that was- There was at least two
or three years where that was my life.

593
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,810
And it was sort of required to-

594
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:03,315
Whenever one was about to have
some sort of life-changing ritual,

595
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,902
it seemed like you would go out
into the woods somewhere to do it.

596
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,237
Whether it was sex or drinking

597
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,490
or just some, you know,
bizarre set of ideas

598
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,160
that were about to occur to you,
you would-

599
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:19,414
I mean, I found myself walking
into these very strange places

600
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,416
either by myself
or with groups of friends

601
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,919
to have these epiphanies.

602
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,087
You know,
life-changing kinds of occurrences.

603
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:31,009
So to me, that's just- Was sort of
the sine qua non of this movie,

604
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:35,096
that they were going to find
themselves out in the woods

605
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:41,561
in some sort of, you know,
Walpurgisnacht of either drinking

606
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,565
or whatever. So that, I guess,
found its way into the movie.

607
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,900
I can't imagine it without it.

608
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,043
It's not a personal memory
in these scenes.

609
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,628
None of these things happened.

610
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,838
But in a strange way,
all of them happened.

611
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,092
I mean, the atmosphere,
it is more like a dream.

612
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:17,889
I mean, oddly enough, I got the idea
for this movie while staring at a twig

613
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,434
moving around,
being buffeted in the wind.

614
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,769
And it was-

615
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,897
Don't ask me why,
but that's what it was.

616
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:31,319
And so somehow these scenes
of the boys running through the woods

617
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:36,449
toward the cave
and all these sort of spindly, bare trees fit.

618
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:42,330
You know, it just-
Somehow part of the creative process

619
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,666
or it came out of that process.

620
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:59,347
I think I have a sort of talismanic scene
in each film subject

621
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:04,853
that means nothing to anybody else or
wouldn't mean anything to anybody else.

622
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,939
<i>In Dead Poets Society, urn,</i>

623
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:13,403
the line of description, you know,
says, "They run to the cave

624
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,616
at night from the school
through the forest" or something.

625
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,867
One sentence or something.

626
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,370
And I remember saying
to my assistant director, to Alan:

627
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,791
"Make sure you allow two or three nights
for this line of description. "

628
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,586
He said,
"Well, you wanna make something of it?"

629
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,380
I said, "Yes. It really means
a great deal to me. "

630
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,091
And in my mind,
I used to see them running,

631
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,428
you know, as it were,
sort of back through time, you know.

632
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,764
In my mind, they were running

633
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,557
through history, back through history,

634
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,018
back to the pasts
of all the secret societies,

635
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,605
through Indians and caves and rituals

636
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,732
and secrets and buried things,

637
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:56,071
and the smell of mildew and damp.
I could smell it.

638
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,323
That's why I wanted them
to have jackets, you know.

639
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,493
That led me to say to Wardrobe,
"I'd like them to have hoods," you know?

640
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,455
They seemed to me to be sort of,
you know, like a Masonic group

641
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,124
or any secret group.

642
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,753
And not all secret groups
were necessarily of course

643
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,215
on the wrong side of the law, you know?

644
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,218
You know, horrible Ku Klux Klan images
come to mind.

645
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,970
But in this case for me, it wasn't that,
it was something else.

646
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:25,016
It was, you know, a brotherhood

647
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,104
or, you know, some sort of oaths.
You know, in other words,

648
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,147
that moment on the plane
where I was flying home

649
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,025
<i>and saw the title,
the Dead Poets Society.</i>

650
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,653
And then they run to a cave. You know,

651
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,073
that was really enough
to make a film about to me in a way.

652
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,245
And Tom had beautifully written it.
Otherwise I'd be still writing it.

653
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,997
But, you know, it was pregnant really

654
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:52,377
with possibilities, with echoes,
you know, beyond the literal.

655
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,131
<i>"I wanted to live deep
and suck out all the marrow of life. "</i>

656
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,799
<i>I'll second that.</i>

657
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,385
<i>"To put to rout all that was not life,</i>

658
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,764
<i>and not, when I had come to die,
discover that I had not lived. "</i>

659
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,978
<i>And Keating's marked
a bunch of other pages.</i>

660
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,479
<i>All right, intermission.</i>

661
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,689
<i>Dig deep, right here.</i>

662
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:17,193
The cave was a set.
It was on the stage. Um...

663
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,490
I remember Peter had a little problem
with the design of it.

664
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,076
The first one we saw
wasn't a very good cave.

665
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,496
It was a very rounded,
artificial-looking cave.

666
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,665
And Pete had it rebuilt

667
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:34,043
and it was a lot better the second time.

668
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,672
We put a little hole in the top

669
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,923
for two reasons basically.

670
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,635
I mean, one, for smoke to get out
when they lit their fires,

671
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:47,223
and, two, that there'd be
a little excuse for a bit of light.

672
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,895
It's funny, I was really disappointed
in a little way about the fire

673
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:57,567
as a lighting thing because
I used it to light from, but we never see it.

674
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,487
In the final edit,
we never ever saw the fire.

675
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,489
And we saw some little sparks
coming up

676
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,826
and I got very excited because
I went to the Special Effects-

677
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,954
And you know, sometimes
movie fires are gas fires,

678
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,207
and they have no sparks.

679
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,877
They make no noise
and that's why they're movie fires.

680
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,086
But I hate them for that.

681
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,798
You know,
I would really love to see sparks.

682
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,802
And I went to the Special Effects guy
and-

683
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,720
To this day,
I can't remember what he used,

684
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,639
but he said, "I can do that. "

685
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,141
He said, "Look, you know,
I can throw this into the fire,

686
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,061
and all these lovely sparks
would come up. "

687
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,730
And I was very disappointed

688
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,107
because we threw those in
and we had those going.

689
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,027
And I thought, you know,
"This is fantastic.

690
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,822
I'm getting sparks for the first time
in my life on a movie fire. "

691
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,867
But it did happen.
The accident happened, you know.

692
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,912
One of the actors
got a little spark in his eye

693
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,373
and of course we had to go
without the sparks.

694
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,583
So after that, in the scene,

695
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,628
I always feel sort of a little bit

696
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,714
that something's missing,
that we never see the fire.

697
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,341
And of course when the sparks went,

698
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,218
we don't get the spark effect either.

699
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,136
All we got was the lighting effect
on them.

700
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,389
So a little disappointed there.

701
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,808
But the scene now that was fairly,

702
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,478
once again,
I hope realistically approached,

703
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,147
that the fire was the main light
in there at night.

704
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:23,069
And then
a little bit of moonlight there to—

705
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:26,990
Coming through that little hole in the roof
and maybe from the door

706
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,659
or the opening of the cave.

707
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,745
But otherwise
it was a good little breakaway cave.

708
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,499
We had little breakaway walls and we
could get the cameras at certain angles.

709
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,544
And of course it was nice and warm
on the stage.

710
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,963
It worked out well.

711
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,214
Well overall, I think.

712
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,634
They did a lot of tests, you know?
It was remarkably hard to get it

713
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,929
as something natural,

714
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,431
as to the level they got it.

715
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,350
You know,
they worked very hard on that.

716
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,228
And it was something
that was flagged right from the beginning

717
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,188
as being, you know-

718
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,735
Boy, you know, film history
is littered with bad caves.

719
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,404
I think you could write a book about it
that no one would buy.

720
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,573
But you could write a book
about the bad caves.

721
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,993
And it's very hard
to get anything natural.

722
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,163
You know,
to make a fake tree is pretty hard.

723
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,874
So they got it right. John lit it beautifully.

724
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,251
Then the scenics came in, you know,
doing tests

725
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,838
to get the moss right and the kind of,
you know, presence of water

726
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,840
and, you know, the dampness.

727
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,593
<i>Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black</i>

728
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,263
I still got it. You know,
I crated it up and took it back to Sydney.

729
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,643
I often go down there
and play my sax and smoke pot.

730
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,270
<i>Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black</i>

731

<i>Cutting through the forest

743

744

745
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,106
At some point, we both agree,

746
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,608
or I suggested to Robin, I think, that:

747
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,944
"Why don't we just have-?
Give you the class one day,

748
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,197
and so at least we've got that in the can. "
And ran two cameras on it.

749
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,908
Over lunch we worked out-
It was an afternoon I think.

750
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,369
We worked out what to do.
We got bunches of books

751
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,829
and things, poetry books

752
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,082
and all kinds of things,
we're looking through.

753
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,501
So we found some Shakespeare.

754
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,586
So he should do something
on Shakespeare.

755
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,089
We're looking through some plays
and things.

756
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,508
And then Dickens.

757
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,052
But he didn't have time
to prepare anything.

758
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,388
He just glanced at headings and things,
so...

759
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,308
You know, it's part of
that remarkable talent of his that he can-

760
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,102
He's a kind of writer, really,

761
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,730
without a pen, you know?
He just writes in the air.

762
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,314
<i>We 're gonna talk about Shakespeare</i>

763
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,984
<i>as someone who writes
something very interesting.</i>

764
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,738
<i>Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare
done very much like this:</i>

765
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,241
<i>O, Titus, bring your friend hither.</i>

766
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,453
In the end, you know,
I said, "Well, I think there's some-

767
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,455
You know, some real nuggets in there. "

768
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,750
So we did take them,
put them into the film.

769
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,961
And I was a bit bothered that
it's used so-

770
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,882
It is used so much in the publicity material
but that- Fair enough.

771
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,801
There was just one day in which,

772
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,221
you know, Mr. Keating let rip.

773
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:41,309
The most important thing that I think
he got out of Robin

774
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,227
through those improvisations

775
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,732
was that he put Robin at ease
with teaching.

776
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,318
You know, because by improvising,
and not having any text,

777
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,488
Robin had to feel what it was like
to come in and connect with those boys

778
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,991
and entertain them
and teach them something and-

779
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,702
So I think it's fitting
that they end up in the film,

780
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,622
those improvisations end up
in the movie.

781
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,665
<i>Why do I stand up here? Anybody?</i>

782
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,167
<i>- To feel taller.
- No.</i>

783
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,295
<i>Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton.</i>

784
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,756
<i>/ stand upon my desk to remind myself</i>

785
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:15,551
<i>that we must constantly look at things
in a different way.</i>

786
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,761
This scene was here too,

787
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,764
and it was a good thing
that that opening got cut,

788
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,850
because it would have been
the third time at the end

789
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,478
as opposed to the second and-

790
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,355
<i>Come see for yourselves. Come on.</i>

791
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,065
I think as a writer at that time,

792
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,442
I would have probably
been overdoing it anyway.

793
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,945
I probably thought,
"We have to have them stand four times

794
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,780
to make the ending mark," you know?

795
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:40,952
But it— Less is more.

796
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,454
And Peter, you know, being who he is,

797
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,916
was well aware of that,
and I think one of the things we did

798
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:51,420
in the early parts
of the revisions process

799
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,840
was to beat all the repetition out.

800
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,844
You know, no rep- As little as possible,

801
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,012
because the audience
just gets it the first time.

802
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,267
They don't need to have things repeated
to understand things.

803
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,978
So since then I've-

804
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,231
You know, having had that experience
and seeing it work the way it did,

805
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:14,694
I just thought, "I'm gonna take that
as the law," you know?

806
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,112
<i>Now, in addition to your essays,</i>

807
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,866
<i>/ would like you to compose a poem
of your own. An original work.</i>

808
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,411
I love sound. I love-

809
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,832
I think whether it's just that much
or whether it was the growing up, it was-

810
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,752
You know, television didn't come
till I was 12 in Sydney.

811
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,254
So radio, you know.

812
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,630
We'd always have one of-

813
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:39,927
A sort of a large radio
and a hi-fi set

814
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,389
sort of in one big cabinet,
pretentious-looking cabinet.

815
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,725
And I think the bottom section

816
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,143
was empty, you know?

817
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,520
But I think you were meant
to put your LPs there.

818
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,064
But it was empty in our house
because we didn't have any.

819
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,234
And then my favorite radio shows,
I would lie down on the floor

820
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:59,655
and sort of put my upper part
inside the cupboard. I opened the door.

821
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,074
Well, it made such a great sound box.

822
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,119
<i>To lie there with your favorite serial
or The Goon Show or something.</i>

823
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,915
And, you know,
it would sort of reverberate, you know?

824
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,167
And I used to love plays and mysteries,

825
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,836
and of course, you know,
they'd do all that, do the sound of shoes

826
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,421
on a gravel path, you know.

827
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:20,885
Rain dripping, you know,
onto leaves. You know, the wind.

828
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,095
The creakings of all kind
for ghost stories.

829
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,556
You know,
so I think I picked all of that up

830
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,227
<i>on what used to be the Caltex Theatre
or something on Sunday night.</i>

831
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,397
And mystery shows,
which were very popular.

832
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,944
So when I'm approaching a soundtrack
now with a good sound designer

833
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,113
as one, you know, arranges,

834
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,740
what a fresh field it is.

835
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:47,203
You know, what an interesting,
interesting and important field.

836
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,623
You can influence the audience.

837
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,126
You can suggest and hint at things
beyond the corners of the frame,

838
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,544
if relevant.

839
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,423
Certainly with any kind of mood
that you're building, of eeriness

840
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,133
or tension.

841
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,927
<i>I'm gonna act.</i>

842
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,887
<i>Aha!</i>

843
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,390
<i>Yes, yes, I'm gonna be an actor.</i>

844
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,558
<i>Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to try this.</i>

845
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,811
<i>/ even tried to go to summer stock
auditions last year...</i>

846
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,896
By the time I actually wrote the first draft,

847
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,607
I knew where, what-
Everything that was gonna happen.

848
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,277
I completely outlined the whole piece.

849
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,489
But I think I— You know,
I was a young writer back then

850
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:24,991
so I don't think I really-

851
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,911
Once I had it all outlined,

852
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,998
it wasn't a matter of aiming it so much.

853
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,916
It was just writing each scene

854
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,252
to be true to what each scene
needed to be.

855
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,213
Keeping the characters consistent,
watching their growth.

856
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,215
So they hopefully grow
through their changes,

857
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,509
their so-called arcs change.

858
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:48,306
And then just dealing with it moment
to moment, starting at the beginning.

859
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,974
So it-

860
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,896
I think that if you keep the ending
in your mind too much while you're writing,

861
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,775
it's gonna be hard
to write anything truthfully, you know,

862
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,486
at the moment,
or write any scene properly

863
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,572
because you're simply gonna be-

864
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,949
You will telegraph things then.

865
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:12,538
So for me, the Neil suicide
was sort of preordained

866
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,207
in the sense that he had a father

867
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,086
who was going to repress him,
suppress him,

868
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,132
keep him from being
who he wanted to be, you know?

869
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,720
All that was required of Neil is that
he be very enthusiastic about something

870
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,346
and be the kind of person who,

871
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,600
because of that enthusiasm,
was too impatient to wait, you know?

872
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,020
I mean, then desperation sets in.

873
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:40,316
And if his father
is sufficiently unyielding,

874
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,526
then I think suicide becomes,

875
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,028
in a sense, the only answer.

876
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,237
The only way out.

877
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:49,492
<i>- this concern,
but I'm not like you, all right?</i>

878
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,369
<i>You say things and people listen.</i>

879
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,122
<i>- I'm not like that.
- Don't you think you could be?</i>

880
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,916
<i>No. I-</i>

881
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,085
I don't look at Neil as really flawed.

882
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,754
I think he's just-
It's youthful enthusiasm that-

883
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,172
I mean, I can remember as-

884
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,633
I broke my leg my senior year
in high school.

885
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,095
And they first told me
I was only gonna be in the hospital,

886
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,346
which would've been great-

887
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,057
They said, "You're gonna be
in the hospital three weeks. "

888
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,976
And I remember feeling like
that was literally a lifetime.

889
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,145
You know, as it turned out,
I was there six months.

890
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:22,274
But- And they were just kind of
letting me down easy but-

891
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,069
And I think it's a bit of
the same thing with Neil, you know.

892
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,531
He just- The notion that he would
have to wait another year or two

893
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,908
to go out on his own,
or maybe even four years,

894
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:35,830
to sort of revisit this acting thing
just seems impossible to handle.

895
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,623
So I don't see it as a character flaw,

896
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,544
but if it works that way,
if it helps us believe

897
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,423
that this is the kind of kid
who would in fact commit suicide,

898
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,926
then I suppose that's useful.

899
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,136
<i>Whoo.</i>

900
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,981
Cannon does literally
cut the film in his mind

901
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:06,026
as he's reading it in prep, say,

902
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:10,573
or when he's actually shooting.
And if you throw him an idea,

903
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:16,203
he has this wonderful habit
of throwing his head forward

904
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,249
and thinking, and you can
literally hear a Moviola running.

905
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,835
And the Moviola's
running the film for him.

906
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,504
Scenes that he hasn't even shot
he will run

907
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,465
because he's balancing your idea

908
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,218
in that particular scene
with all the scenes around it.

909
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,722
He's very conscious of the rhythm
and the flow of the film.

910
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,349
And I think that by doing that,

911
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,562
it means that he can analyze

912
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,023
where he's going, what he's got

913
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,152
and include that in the rhythm
and the flow of the final result.

914
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,070
And it's quite wonderful
because you can-

915
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,240
When you throw him an idea,
he goes into his Moviola mode

916
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,159
and runs the film.

917
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,493
And it's quite wonderful

918
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,080
because he can be silent
for a long time.

919
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,709
In the early days, I used to think,
"Oh, he hasn't understood what I've said. "

920
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,337
But he is. He's actually running the idea.

921
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,965
And he will come up
with this wonderfully logical answer like:

922
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:15,304
"It's a great idea but if I use that now,
I've blown it two scenes from now,

923
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,598
I've blown the cover.

924
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,059
And I need to hold back on that.

925
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,937
And it's a lovely idea
but I can't use it at this moment. "

926
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,189
And you know why.
And he explains why.

927
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:30,194
I think that's very wonderful to a technician
who's possibly trying to keep up with him

928
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:35,115
as far as the ideas for the film
are concerned.

929
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,910
<i>For me,
sport is actually a chance for us</i>

930
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,163
<i>to have other human beings
push us to excel.</i>

931
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:47,795
In my high school,
you did a different sport each semester.

932
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,004
Or each quarter, I think.

933
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:53,676
So in the fall I did football
and in the winter I did soccer.

934
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:58,180
And so, you know,
soccer just naturally fit

935
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,557
with this whole idea

936
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,811
of reading these bits of the poem
and kicking the ball to it.

937
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:08,440
I don't know where-
Why that occurred to me.

938
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,443
But part of what you have to do
when you write

939
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,281
is sort of give yourself over
to the stream of consciousness that's-

940
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,535
I mean, I consider writing a little bit
like being on the psychiatric couch.

941
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,787
You lie down and, you know, there's-

942
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,415
You don't see the psychiatrist,
you start talking,

943
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:25,708
and your mind just wanders.

944
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,877
And pretty soon you find out
what's important to you and what's not.

945
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,921
And what's bothering you, what's not.

946
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,591
What are the sort of key moments
in your life?

947
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,344
And it's the same with writing.
You find out- You sort of—

948
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,179
Someone said,
maybe it was Dorothy Parker:

949
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,391
"I write to find out what I think,"
and that's-

950
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,727
You know, I guess I ramble,
I look at twigs.

951
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,856
I— You know, I have these experiences,
and they-

952
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:53,819
I start writing and then at some point,
my brain organizes them

953
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,697
and they become
hopefully more coherent.

954
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:00,784
But until that time,
they're just a part of

955
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:05,080
a sort of dream-like consciousness
that has-

956
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,623
That may have something to say.

957
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,710
And if I trust it long enough,

958
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,588
you know, it will come out hopefully.

959
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,715
<i>Charlie, I got it.</i>

960
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:18,135
<i>- Congratulations.
- Good for you, Neil. Good for you.</i>

961
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,221
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

962
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,265
Well, everything-

963
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,684
It's terribly important
to keep your flame alive, I think.

964
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,186
It's very fragile,

965
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,355
your motivation.

966
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,023
If you wanna have a long career...

967
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,233
Or you're lucky enough
to have a long career.

968
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,029
And in my case, I take my precautions.

969
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:40,449
You know, however conscious
or unconscious they are.

970
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,243
You know, I try to keep myself-

971
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,913
I don't say clean.
If I say clean, it sounds odd.

972
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,040
I mean, probably clean
in the nuclear sense,

973
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:53,128
you know, to kind of remove radiation
off my body.

974
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,632
And to do that, I— You know,
I try and have a life outside of film.

975
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,551
I try and- I try and read a lot.

976
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:03,138
And, you know, much as I love movies,
I'll go all the time,

977
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,183
but, you know, to listen to music.

978
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,560
And I think in my case,

979
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,730
I prefer to live outside
of the film community.

980
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,566
So I happen to be in Sydney,
north of the city.

981
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,944
I have friends who are in the business,
of course.

982
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:22,241
But I find that all of this
helps me keep the enthusiasm

983
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,827
that I had when I first started.

984
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:29,123
Because I saw fairly early on
that you could come to hate filmmaking.

985
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,792
You could come to hate the process.

986
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,838
It's very difficult and, you know,
you do clash with people and you have,

987
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:41,802
you know, all kinds of sort of intensified
emotional experiences.

988
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:44,805
You know, you could just

989
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,891
get bored with it.

990
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:52,604
So I realized, you know,
this was my, you know, determination

991
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,524
not to kill the golden goose.

992
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,694
It's funny to say "the golden goose. "
I used to think, living in Australia,

993
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,946
that I was like Jack, you know.

994
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,948
With a farm and an ax

995
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,950
and a huge beanstalk that I'd climb up,

996
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:08,162
and I found this castle,
which was not so much-

997
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,623
And the giant,
not so much Hollywood as filmmaking.

998
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,792
So I could go up there
and I could play the lyre

999
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:17,004
and the giant would give me a golden egg
every now and again, you know?

1000
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,715
And I'd go back down to the farm.

1001
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:24,261
And I've always got the ax ready,
you know, but I've never cut it down.

1002
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:29,516
But somehow going between
the palace and the farm keeps me

1003
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:33,103
mentally or creatively fit.

1004
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,899
People go to the gym, but I think
it's better to go to the creative gym

1005
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:40,569
in a way.
The body can take care of itself.

1006
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,324
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins.</i>

1007
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:48,744
<i>You have the first poem to ever have
a negative score on the Pritchard scale.</i>

1008
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,372
<i>We 're not laughing at you,
we're laughing near you.</i>

1009
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,541
<i>/ don't mind that your poem
had a simple theme.</i>

1010
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,835
<i>The most beautiful poetry
can be about simple things</i>

1011
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,671
<i>like a cat, or a flower, or rain.</i>

1012
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,008
<i>You see, poetry can come from anything
with the stuff of revelation in it.</i>

1013
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,344
I knew that when I got to this scene-

1014
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,013
Because I can remember
that I had put myself in a box

1015
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,351
where I was gonna actually have to write a
poem that would appear to be improvised.

1016
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:15,813
It would have to be good enough
that the class would accept it,

1017
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,815
maybe even give the boy
applause for it.

1018
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,360
And the teacher would find it amazing.
I remember just being terrified.

1019
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,196
You know, this is coming.
I'm gonna have to do this.

1020
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:28,033
And I think I wrote it
in much the same way Todd does it.

1021
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,203
I just simply- Just closed my eyes
and just started writing.

1022
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,497
And this- I got through it,
I looked and I thought:

1023
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,041
"Well, okay, it's- A little work, you know.

1024
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,086
Next draft, it might be okay,"
so...

1025
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,629
And I remember watching this.

1026
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:45,133
Being obsessed that Ethan
was leaving out a word, "a. "

1027
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,762
He was- "The truth is like a blanket
that never leaves your feet. "

1028
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,013
He would just leave out-

1029
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,017
"Truth, a blanket that never-
Always leaves your feet cold. "

1030
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,645
And I kept saying, going up to him
between takes and going:

1031
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,481
"Truth is like a blanket. "
He'd go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. "

1032
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:03,944
And Peter finally turned to me because
I was pacing around worrying about this.

1033
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:08,282
He's going, "What's the problem?"
I said, "This. He's leaving out the letter 'a. '"

1034
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,867
He said- I said,
"It's not gonna make any sense that way. "

1035
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,287
And he goes,
"Oh, please. Don't be ridiculous. "

1036
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:17,040
And I look back and I realize
it's just the quintessential example

1037
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:21,795
of a writer, you know,
protecting their script, but...

1038
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,173
<i>Gotta get in yawping stance.</i>

1039
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,511
And his kind of use of
the camera, it was always to serve the idea.

1040
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,847
And not for its own sake.
You know, I'd hate to think

1041
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:36,268
that, you know, I use something
for its own sake.

1042
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,937
I'm just not from that school
of filmmaking.

1043
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,481
And there is a school of that,
and it's okay.

1044
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,691
Some stuffs good.

1045
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,235
That's to make you very aware
of the camera.

1046
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:50,407
But in this case, yeah, it was a very
self-conscious camera movement,

1047
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:53,952
and I think I did it
because it seemed appropriate.

1048
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,415
It seemed like it was time
to shake up my own convention.

1049
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:03,003
It was time for the screen

1050
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,382
to give you a feeling of what
was happening between these two,

1051
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,552
the man and- The teacher and the pupil.

1052
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,264
He was taking the camera in a way.

1053
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,808
Robin is taking the camera
and spinning it.

1054
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,646
He is saying,
"Let's get this camera off the tripod.

1055
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,315
Let's just throw it around here.

1056
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,401
Come on. Open up.
Open up, you know.

1057
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,236
Let it go. "

1058
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,573
It's a kind of violence.

1059
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,244
And sometimes, you know, you need to do
it to yourself or someone may shake you.

1060
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,414
You know, it's like you say in life,
"I feel like shaking her.

1061
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,292
I feel like taking him by the shoulders
and shaking him.

1062
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,627
Wake up. "

1063
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,129
You know, or something,
whatever it is in life.

1064
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,965
And so I think Robin
is dangerously close.

1065
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,884
There he's really
on the edge of something.

1066
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,969
He knows that boy could be lost

1067
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:57,057
and just sort of retreat
into some kind of neurosis.

1068
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,144
And yet he can see how close he is
to come- And senses that the boy

1069
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:05,315
is very talented.

1070
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,069
Out of all those kids, he might be
the one that goes on to be- Not Neil.

1071
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:13,740
To be the- To be an artist. Who knows?

1072
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,534
And-

1073
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:20,497
And so, anyway, it seemed appropriate
that we got in there, and...

1074
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,833
I remember at the time,
you know, watching the dailies

1075
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,419
that next night or something, thinking:

1076
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,505
"I think it's okay but it's ostentatious. "

1077
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,675
It's also sort of the capper

1078
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:36,012
of the emotional note that Todd is on
in class, you know?

1079
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,682
It is the high point of the movie.

1080
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:43,854
It's where this boy, for the first time,
finds a voice.

1081
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,899
So the need for this kind of celebration

1082
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,319
to kind of highlight it,

1083
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,363
I think is—

1084
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,991
It felt right to me, but...

1085
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,327
And I think it is the last montage.

1086
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,002
<i>- Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply.
- My dad collects a lot of pipes.</i>

1087
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,506
You know,
saying Keating's not really a '60s man.

1088
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:16,428
In the sense,
I don't think he'd be an active member

1089
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,347
of the sort of counterculture.

1090
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,184
Wherever he goes to. I think
he'd go off to England or something.

1091
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,936
But I think the boys
would probably, quite a few of them,

1092
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,440
of the Dead Poets, would have
got caught up in the '60s in various ways.

1093
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:32,652
And I think that's reflected
in the cave scene.

1094
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,656
You know, where you have really a sort of,
through music,

1095
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:40,327
a hint of the sort of looking back
toward the sort of jazz-beat thing

1096
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,829
that they'd have been reading about
and heard on the radio.

1097
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,623
And smoking pipes,

1098
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:49,086
which is sort of almost the forerunner
of what will shortly be dope smoking.

1099
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,589
And in that same cave,
at that same school as it were,

1100
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:57,719
would have been joints passed around
in a few short years.

1101
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,639
You know, which I'm saying
as if it's some advance of civilization,

1102
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:05,060
which I don't really think we can say. "Oh,
in those days then, you smoked tobacco.

1103
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,854
Of course, you know, now,

1104
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,608
in our caves today,
of course we don't. We smoke joints. "

1105
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,360
<i>Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming</i>

1106
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,320
<i>Gotta do more, gotta be more.</i>

1107
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,990
The reason that all the politics was left out

1108
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,744
is it's just absent from our lives
in high school.

1109
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,331
That was the case for Peter
and I think for Robin too,

1110
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:30,252
but certainly for me, that we were cut off
from that, you know.

1111
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,963
It just was- We were in that world

1112
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:37,884
of our own lives, you know.

1113
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,512
And the war and-

1114
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,598
By the time I was in high school,
the war in Vietnam was raging.

1115
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,142
There was already a national debate.
I was involved in it.

1116
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,146
But when I was this age, you know,

1117
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,151
or when I was a little bit younger,
it just didn't, you know,

1118
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:58,989
sort of penetrate the bubble
of my concerns with girlfriends,

1119
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,824
and, you know, that whole bit.

1120
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:06,663
So I think our sense of this school was
that it had successfully cut these boys off

1121
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,582
from the outside world.

1122
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:12,878
<i>I can't take it anymore.
If I don't have Chris, I'm gonna kill myself.</i>

1123
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,838
<i>Knoxious, you've gotta calm down.</i>

1124
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,923
<i>No, Charlie.</i>

1125
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:21,136
<i>That's just my problem.
I've been calm all my life.</i>

1126
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:22,679
<i>I'm gonna do something about that.</i>

1127
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,806
You know, and the romantic part of it,

1128
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,391
this Chris and Knox business

1129
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,393
really starts to take over
in the movie here.

1130
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,686
You know, it's that-

1131
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:33,148
It is very self-involved and,
you're right, it is very sentimental.

1132
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:38,987
But it's also, I believe, true to what being
sort of 15, 16 years old

1133
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,447
was like back then.

1134
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:43,283
You know, for most of us.
And there were certainly kids,

1135
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,620
and I can remember them,
who were involved in politics.

1136
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,539
Even- You know, and aware
of the civil rights movement,

1137
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:54,586
the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley,
the beginning of the anti-war movement,

1138
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,005
even when we were 14, 15 years old.

1139
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,342
But for better or worse, most of us were

1140
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:04,054
caught up in belonging or not belonging

1141
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,640
and our relationship to school
and to each other

1142
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,392
and to our love life
and that sort of thing.

1143
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,731
So... And I think if you add to that
this school which intentionally-

1144
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,816
These kinds of schools
which intentionally-

1145
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,402
You know, no TV, no radio.

1146
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,906
Nothing that will permit you
to sort of connect with the outside world

1147
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,575
and find out what's going on,
that's what you're left with.

1148
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,996
You're left with this sort of
sentimental, timeless

1149
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,998
kind of growing-up period in your life.

1150
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,416
<i>- Okay, thank you.
- Okay, bye.</i>

1151
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,710
<i>Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.</i>

1152
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,255
<i>У aw pi</i>

1153
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,258
I think
we all have the desire to be bubbled.

1154
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:48,890
It would be nice not to have to deal
with the enormity of the troubles

1155
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:53,728
in the world around us, you know.
And there's no escaping it.

1156
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,356
We're gonna have to deal with it
at some point in our lives.

1157
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,360
But I think that, at least in America
at this time,

1158
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,279
and maybe in the '80s too, there was-

1159
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:07,200
And that's, I guess, why people
sort of found the '80s and the '50s

1160
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,912
to be so similar, that

1161
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:16,126
there was this isolationist-
Kind of this desire to just,

1162
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,920
you know, get rich and enjoy life

1163
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:22,841
and not have to deal with
all the problems of the world.

1164
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,260
And I think to some extent,

1165
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,470
the Keating character's kind of coming in
and saying:

1166
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,181
"There's more out there," you know?

1167
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,435
But it's not political.
There's more out there in literature.

1168
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,187
There's more out there.
There's more complexity in the world

1169
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,064
than you have any idea of.

1170
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,693
So he's here to shake things up
that way.

1171
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:46,990
And it's- In its own way,
that's what it may have tapped into.

1172
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,369
<i>There it is.</i>

1173
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,297
<i>/ don't know, but I've been told</i>

1174
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,215
<i>/ don't know, but I've been told</i>

1175
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,134
<i>Doing poetry is old</i>

1176
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,594
<i>Doing poetry is old</i>

1177
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:11,097
<i>Left, left, left, right, left.</i>

1178
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,726
<i>Left, left, left, right, left.</i>

1179
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,394
<i>Left, halt.</i>

1180
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,105
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

1181
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:24,027
<i>If you noticed, everyone started off
with their own stride, their own pace.</i>

1182
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:28,406
Right before Neil

1183
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,201
performs his play, I believe.

1184
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,287
And...

1185
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,540
It just- It's been so long.
I'd have to look in a script to remember.

1186
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,835
But I think the boys-
It may have been right after this scene.

1187
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:44,172
The boys are taught this lesson
about conformity.

1188
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,884
This silly little scene of walking around
in the courtyard.

1189
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,386
And then I think

1190
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,265
they come to class the next time
and Keating's not there.

1191
01:04:54,432 --> 01:05:00,939
And there may have been a scene
where Knox goes to the party

1192
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:06,319
and then they go to see Keating
in the hospital.

1193
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,488
<i>"That's baa-d. "</i>

1194
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:13,701
<i>Robert Frost said,
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,</i>

1195
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:17,747
<i>/ took the one less traveled by,
and that has made all the difference. "</i>

1196
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,375
<i>Now, I want you to find your own walk
right now.</i>

1197
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:24,212
<i>Your own way of striding, pacing.
Any direction, anything you want.</i>

1198
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,965
<i>Whether it's proud,
whether it's silly, anything.</i>

1199
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,718
<i>Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.</i>

1200
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:36,891
<i>You don't have to perform,
just make it for yourself.</i>

1201
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:40,770
<i>Mr. Dalton, you be joining us?</i>

1202
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,106
<i>Exercising the right not to walk.</i>

1203
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,527
<i>Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
You just illustrated the point.</i>

1204
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,071
<i>Swim against the stream.</i>

1205
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,203
Perhaps the fact that,

1206
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,332
you know, they're really
contrary personalities-

1207
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:05,295
Bobby and Ethan
are actually playing the other.

1208
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,591
- gave it an edge because
I couldn't have asked for more from them.

1209
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,802
I thought they were wonderful separately

1210
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,096
and wonderful together.

1211
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,932
Again I come back to the thing of,
"Oh, what is my job?"

1212
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,059
I stand by the camera.

1213
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,980
I've just gotta stop the camera
if it's not believable. It's not credible.

1214
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:28,401
It's not- It's just not right, you know.

1215
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:31,613
Because you've seen it
in your mind's eye.

1216
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:35,617
Or you lived it in the past
or you know it somehow.

1217
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,703
And you just have to keep doing it
until it's right or something.

1218
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:43,875
And so those two perfectly fulfilled it.
I mean, they-

1219
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:49,214
The sort of apparent weakness in Todd,
the stuttering

1220
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,717
and that kind of failure of nerve

1221
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,553
that becomes transmuted
into courage.

1222
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,016
Whereas Neil, who is urging him on,
who appears to have the courage,

1223
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:04,270
falters and a crack opens
in his personality

1224
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,815
and he becomes the weak one.

1225
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:13,738
So in a sense they get- Both characters
get to play aspects of the other.

1226
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,449
Both possess courage
and both possess weakness.

1227
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:20,078
One overcomes it
and one is— Succumbs to it.

1228
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,749
So in a sense,
they're the same character in a way.

1229
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,876
But, well, you know,
they're only young men

1230
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,463
whose personalities
are being formed.

1231
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:34,217
You can go in this way or that.
You know, which way will your life go?

1232
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:38,346
Which quality in you
will form your character?

1233
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,640
You know,
hopefully for the better or for the worst,

1234
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,141
as it of course, can happen.

1235
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,351
<i>Oh, my.</i>

1236
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,727
It's what teachers must know.

1237
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,606
You know, these are young people
whose personalities are just taking shape.

1238
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,608
That's why their job's so critical.

1239
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,987
<i>To live deep
And suck out all the marrow of life.</i>

1240
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,863
<i>To put to rout all that was not life.</i>

1241
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,159
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1242
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,163
I vaguely remember
that there was another scene

1243
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,332
with the girls at the cave.

1244
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,377
But I can't remember what it was.

1245
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:13,631
There may have been a scene

1246
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:17,260
where Charlie had sex
with one of these girls at the cave.

1247
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:21,431
Or at least it was hinted at, but I—

1248
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,641
Maybe it might have been intercut with-

1249
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,144
At least in the script,
with the scene at the party,

1250
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:28,688
but it's been so long, I don't remember.

1251
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:31,649
<i>Come on, folks, it's
Friday night. Let's get on with the meeting.</i>

1252
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:32,859
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1253
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,360
<i>Guys, I have an announcement to make.</i>

1254
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,988
And I had the Keating feeling

1255
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,448
as a young man and-

1256
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:45,371
Because then I was going to
head into this, you know, gypsy life.

1257
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,707
You know, this filmmaking,
as it happened.

1258
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,168
It could have been
something else creative,

1259
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:54,672
but I was that kind of personality,
if it was headed that way, so...

1260
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,467
One, I would have joined
the Dead Poets Society, but-

1261
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,177
If there'd been one. But two, I was-

1262
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:03,973
In my own mind, was already thinking
along these lines

1263
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,851
and finding romance and things.

1264
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:10,146
That's why I understood those boys
so much.

1265
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,733
I was heading to be a- I don't know what.
You know, a lawyer or something.

1266
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:19,238
We were all on railway tracks then.
We were postwar babies.

1267
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,157
<i>But, Chris-
CHRIS: Make yourself at home.</i>

1268
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:22,742
<i>But I-</i>

1269
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,124
<i>Baby, baby
Let's make romance</i>

1270
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:35,672
<i>You know your old-time lover
Hasn't got-</i>

1271
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,550
I think this boy that
came in and does the Mutt scene-

1272
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:43,596
He came in and said, "All I wanna do
is be the guy that says 'Mutt. '"

1273
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:48,017
You know, and Peter fell in love with him
right away.

1274
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,271
And I think in one version
we had "fucking Mutt. "

1275
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,066
That was our- That was the fight
we had with the studio.

1276
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,026
But at the end of the day
we didn't need it.

1277
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,487
I can't remember what happened there.

1278
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,407
<i>- Have some whiskey, pal.
- Yeah.</i>

1279
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,117
<i>/ don't really drink-</i>

1280
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,078
<i>- To Mutt.
- То Mutt.</i>

1281
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,330
<i>To Mutt.</i>

1282
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,876
<i>Now, how the hell is old Mutt anyway?</i>

1283
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,962
<i>Yeah, what's old Mutter
been up to, huh?</i>

1284
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,340
<i>/ don't really know Mutt.</i>

1285
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,302
<i>- To the Mighty Mutt.
- To Mighty Mutt.</i>

1286
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,054
<i>To Mighty Mutt.</i>

1287
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,181
Well, there are really four tracks.

1288
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:30,184
There's Charlie, there's Knox,
there's Todd and there's Neil.

1289
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:34,772
And I think the Todd track,
it can't really go too far

1290
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,525
because at this point in the movie,
at least structurally,

1291
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,569
because this is-

1292
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,155
He's only got one more step to make,
you know.

1293
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,949
So his character at this moment

1294
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:49,078
I think we imagine
that he's not a prolific writer,

1295
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:54,167
but he's having some success
writing and expressing himself.

1296
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:59,797
And, uh, Neil too has sort of announced
that he's in this play,

1297
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,884
rehearsals are underway, so we are-

1298
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,261
You know, there really
almost isn't anything to do

1299
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,264
but see Knox,

1300
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,058
and whether he's gonna be successful
with Chris.

1301
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,770
I mean, that's really
the only thread that's-

1302
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:17,773
That hasn't been addressed
in the movie.

1303
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:22,278
Because I remember going back and forth
on that in my mind when I was writing

1304
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,905
as to whether he would-

1305
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:28,576
He and Chris would become an item
or not.

1306
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,496
Because everybody else
sort of comes to-

1307
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:36,626
I mean, by the end of the movie,
everybody except Knox

1308
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,921
has sort of had a bad time of it,
you know.

1309
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:45,968
Neil's dead and Todd's
being put back in that box.

1310
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:52,141
And Charlie's been thrown out of school
so...

1311
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:56,729
And it's possible that the screen time
that Knox gets with Chris

1312
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:01,776
is kind of subconsciously a way
of putting more hope into the movie.

1313
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,529
And it- I don't know.

1314
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:08,241
It's very difficult to sort of look at it,
particularly this far in the distance,

1315
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,744
and know why you did anything,
you know.

1316
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,791
<i>God help me.</i>

1317
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,919
<i>Ooh, baby, you're not mine</i>

1318
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,132
<i>Hey, little girl</i>

1319
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:28,261
<i>How's about a date?</i>

1320
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,764
It's funny, I just-
The more we talk about it,

1321
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:35,226
the less I know about anything
about my process of writing the movie.

1322
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,687
I mean, it all seemed obvious to me
when I was doing it.

1323
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:41,774
But in hindsight, so much of it
is about the unconscious

1324
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,068
and just sort of making choices

1325
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:46,821
that you think
are the only choices possible.

1326
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,657
But 100 writers
would make 100 different choices.

1327
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:53,828
So it's tricky. A tricky process.

1328
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,329
And in the movie business,

1329
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:58,874
it's not like novels where you can just write
and someone else will edit it

1330
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,879
and then it's out there, and you don't really
have to understand your own process.

1331
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,006
In this business,
they're gonna come at you.

1332
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,175
As soon as you turn it in, there are gonna
be questions about everything.

1333
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,970
There's nothing you do that someone's
not gonna come up and go:

1334
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:14,265
"Why are we making this this way?"
And you've gotta have an answer.

1335
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:18,477
You know? And it's gotta be contained
in the internal logic of the piece.

1336
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,230
But they never ask you sort of
about the external logic of it.

1337
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:25,776
"Why did-?" You know, "Why do they go
to caves as opposed to bars?" You know?

1338
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:30,114
That's just-
That they don't worry about. But...

1339
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,575
Well, they wanna know why the-

1340
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:36,329
"Why did you put in that this character
wears this kind of coat as opposed to-?"

1341
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,289
And you've gotta know all those things.

1342
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:42,168
"And why does this scene happen here?
Why can't we move the whole ending-?"

1343
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,754
I mean, that was-
The studio notes on this script were-

1344
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,715
The first set of notes were terrifying.
You know, it was-

1345
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,259
That was another part of this process
that was just-

1346
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,346
You know, you sell it and then
you don't know what they wanna do.

1347
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,681
I even remember saying to my agent,
"They wanna buy it,

1348
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,017
but what's their vision of this?"

1349
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:01,187
He goes, "You can't ask.
You don't do it that way. "

1350
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,649
I go, "This is my baby. I've suffered
four years trying to get this made. "

1351
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:09,445
And he said, "Sorry, you just have to sell it
and trust that they're buying it.

1352
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,782
They're buying it for a reason.
They're gonna do it right. " And then I got-

1353
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,369
About a week later, I got about
40 pages of notes saying things like:

1354
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,205
"Well, the teacher is the main character
of this piece

1355
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:22,291
but he's really not in it very often
so let's- We need to change this.

1356
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,585
Let's start the movie with him
in high school

1357
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,004
and watch- And get rid of these kids. "
Blah, blah, blah.

1358
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:31,133
And then it just went on from there.
And I went, "Oh, my God. " You know?

1359
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,969
"They're just gutting it.
They don't get it at all. "

1360
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,180
And went to the first meeting
at the studio

1361
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:39,058
and there was a group of junior executives
in the room

1362
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,894
and myself and Steven Haft
and Jeff Katzenberg.

1363
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,314
And Katzenberg was sitting in a chair
kind of going like this with the notes.

1364
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,775
Just reading,
almost like he was speed-reading them.

1365
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:51,320
And I went, "Oh, God. " And we just
sat there for minute after minute.

1366
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,781
And I thought, "Oh, this-"
Because I was sweating.

1367
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,367
I was so angry and conflicted about it.

1368
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,703
And the producer said, "Let's-
Should we just listen?"

1369
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,872
Katzenberg closed it up and said,
"Who did the notes?"

1370
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,334
And one of the executives said,
"Well, it was sort of me and so-and-so.

1371
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,129
They're not really polished yet.
I hope they're clear. "

1372
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,214
And he goes,
"We're kind of throwing the baby out

1373
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,924
with the bathwater, aren't we?"

1374
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,592
And they said, "Well-"

1375
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:17,388
And he went- Threw him over his—
Back behind the chair.

1376
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,515
And he said,
"Let's just make the movie. "

1377
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:23,519
And started talking about casting,
and that was it.

1378
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,647
And they never had a big note
after that.

1379
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,569
It was a great moment for me.

1380
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,743
<i>Sit.</i>

1381
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,958
<i>This week's issue of Welton Honor,</i>

1382
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:49,628
<i>there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article.</i>

1383
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:54,925
<i>Rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons-</i>

1384
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,678
<i>And let me assure you, I will find them.</i>

1385
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:01,348
Norman Lloyd,
I'm grateful that he took the part.

1386
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:07,855
And his experience and background,
quite remarkable

1387
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:11,150
both as an actor and as a director
or producer.

1388
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:15,780
He worked with Orson Welles.
He knew Chaplin well.

1389
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:18,783
Hitch, as he would call him.
Alfred Hitchcock.

1390
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:23,537
<i>He worked as a co-producer
on Hitchcock's Hour.</i>

1391
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,583
And appeared in, you know,
countless plays and films.

1392
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,376
And is quite an authority

1393
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:34,381
on the interesting and less-discussed side
of Hollywood,

1394
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,051
which is— You know, of course,
it's always the glamour.

1395
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:40,096
But on the creative side and on the-

1396
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,097
He knew all the artists

1397
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,391
and was one himself.

1398
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,311
So I very much enjoyed talking
with him.

1399
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:50,231
Yet in no sense does he just,
you know, give you anecdotes.

1400
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,650
You have to really, you know,
ask him about things.

1401
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:57,363
Because he's, you know, still a working
actor and very involved in this project,

1402
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:04,411
and had very good and strong views
about the headmaster that he was playing.

1403
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:10,084
And made him real,
yet in an older tradition.

1404
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:12,253
A less subtle tradition of human being.

1405
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:17,758
You know, these were men who have
immense respect in the community

1406
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:21,595
and was shortly about to
go through hell

1407
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,516
at those prep schools,
from my research.

1408
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,017
Those headmasters-

1409
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,688
I mean, for example,
if this headmaster at the school

1410
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,565
had stayed on to-

1411
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:35,901
You know, into the late '60s,
he would have probably dropped dead.

1412
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,320
I mean, they would have given him
such a hard time

1413
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,698
with their student protests
and whatever, so...

1414
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,534
That was a very difficult year
and was the end, really,

1415
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:46,537
at colleges and most institutions

1416
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:50,791
of authority incarnate
and the sort of ship's captain

1417
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:54,003
that a headmaster
or headmistress was.

1418
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,965
That sort of- You know, they could
have the power of life and death over you.

1419
01:17:58,132 --> 01:18:00,050
So he gave that to me,
and he was very much

1420
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,304
like teachers that I-
Headmasters that I had known

1421
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:08,225
on the stricter side. There was one I knew
who was a gentler soul.

1422
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:12,396
And I would enjoy any time
that we could get chatting,

1423
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,523
you know, off the set about-

1424
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,277
About the many productions
he'd been involved with.

1425
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:21,739
You know, and it was really for me.
Tell me about Welles.

1426
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,449
You know, tell me about Chaplin.

1427
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:29,955
And I felt connected to a tradition myself
of filmmaking through him.

1428
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,916
It's so recent

1429
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,418
as an art form.

1430
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:37,004
It's extraordinary
to remind yourself of it.

1431
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:38,714
You know, if you're a sculptor,

1432
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,676
you know, you can go crawling
over the ruins of Rome and Egypt.

1433
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:46,388
You know,
and back into the thousands of BCs.

1434
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,476
And for filmmaking,
you can probably just at a squeeze

1435
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,728
still meet people that worked
in the silent era.

1436
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,688
Still alive just.

1437
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:59,860
I certainly did as a young man.
You know, was meeting people who'd

1438
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,904
worked in silent movies

1439
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,781
and in sound movies.

1440
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,121
<i>I'm hearing rumors, John,</i>

1441
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:14,124
<i>about some unorthodox teaching methods
in your classroom.</i>

1442
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:18,754
<i>I'm not saying they've had anything to do
with the Dalton boy's outburst,</i>

1443
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:23,550
<i>but I don't think I have to warn you,
boys his age are very impressionable.</i>

1444
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:25,719
Norman Lloyd, for those who don't know,

1445
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:28,806
is one of the cofounders
of the Mercury Theatre with Orson Welles

1446
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:34,853
and I think produced everything
that the Mercury Theatre did.

1447
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,274
You know, Norman is sort of one of the-
And he acted in many productions

1448
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,152
at the Mercury Theatre
and many of Orson Welles' movies,

1449
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:47,282
so he's one of our great actors
and producers in the theater.

1450
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,953
And I think he brings
that kind of presence to the movie,

1451
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,288
you know, as a headmaster.

1452
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:57,459
He sort of has an instant kind of

1453
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:03,215
believability because of
his long history as an actor.

1454
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,467
<i>Creak.</i>

1455
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:10,723
<i>He starts walking around
towards my left. Creak.</i>

1456
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:13,058
<i>Creak.</i>

1457
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,729
<i>"Assume the position, Mr. Dalton. "</i>

1458
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,273
<i>It's all right, gentlemen.</i>

1459
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,277
It was odd because
when we were doing the casting,

1460
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:24,903
there really did seem

1461
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:28,490
like there was only one right person
for every part, you know.

1462
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:32,202
There was no other person who could play
the Keating character but Robin

1463
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,912
and Norman just-

1464
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,416
I mean, everybody else
seemed to either be too harsh

1465
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:41,879
or not of sufficient stature
to play the headmaster,

1466
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,173
and so forth.
And the same with the boys.

1467
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,884
You know, there was just-
To find someone like Ethan Hawke,

1468
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,761
someone who wants to be an actor

1469
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,639
who can be-
seemed to be naturally shy on-screen

1470
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,016
is just an amazing thing.

1471
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,476
I mean, it's so hard.

1472
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:59,396
I mean, most people who wanna be actors
are not shy. You know, so-

1473
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,232
And they can't play that, so...

1474
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,318
And Ethan has that quality, I think,

1475
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,195
that it seems to be really him who's-

1476
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,489
And in life, he couldn't be
more the opposite.

1477
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:12,701
He's an outgoing, gregarious,
you know,

1478
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,412
kind of rangy guy, so...

1479
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,873
Others seemed to-
Weren't interesting in playing that.

1480
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,294
Didn't seem to really have the same-
You know, the issues in their soul

1481
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:26,173
that Ethan just emanated.

1482
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,635
You know, so...
Or emanated from Ethan, so...

1483
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,850
<i>We 're trying to rehearse, okay?</i>

1484
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,186
<i>A good persuasion.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.</i>

1485
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:43,107
<i>Wait, please. Excitement.
I don't hear any excitement about this play.</i>

1486
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,734
<i>And take her hand.</i>

1487
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:51,949
<i>Bring her down the stage and stop, and,
"There, gentle Hermia. " Try again.</i>

1488
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,702
<i>- What's for dinner?
- Spaghetti and meatballs.</i>

1489
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,916
<i>Save some for me.</i>

1490
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,504
<i>But, room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.</i>

1491
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:10,384
My sense of Neil's father was the kind
of person who would track you down.

1492
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:11,802
You would not get away.

1493
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:14,054
You know, you would-
You'd stick your thumb out.

1494
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:17,558
You'd end up in a city. And one day,
just at the moment of greatest happiness,

1495
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:20,018
you would be take- Whisked away.

1496
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,813
You know, and I think in fact
in the original draft,

1497
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,525
and this is something we modified,
that Neil's father did not just wait

1498
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,986
in the back of the theater
for Neil to finish that play.

1499
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,363
He actually went
into the wings of the play,

1500
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,532
and when Neil came off
in the middle of the play,

1501
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,325
he said, "You're coming with me. "

1502
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:39,788
And of course,
the teachers producing the play said,

1503
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,582
you know, "He's gotta finish the play. "

1504
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,792
And he said,
"No, get somebody else to finish. "

1505
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,378
So someone else was dressed up
and went out as Puck.

1506
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:51,049
It was that kind of repression
that Neil was dealing with,

1507
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:54,970
that sense that if your father said
"this is the way it's gonna be,"

1508
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,471
that that would be the way it is.

1509
01:22:56,638 --> 01:23:01,560
So I think that for good reasons,
that was changed in the movie,

1510
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,105
but I think that
that quality about his father

1511
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:09,985
and that sense on Neil's part that
that's who his father was remain.

1512
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,572
You know, if you think the parents were
over-the-top at the beginning of the movie,

1513
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,867
then imagine that scene
and it might have-

1514
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:19,786
I think it was wise
to sort of back it off a little bit.

1515
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:23,749
That was one of the things
Peter and I talked about in Australia

1516
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:26,752
and when he first came
to start preproduction.

1517
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:30,422
And it was,
"We need to change that moment. "

1518
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,845
<i>I made a great many sacrifices
to get you here, Neil.</i>

1519
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,890
<i>And you will not let me down.</i>

1520
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,060
<i>No, sir.</i>

1521
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:46,063
The guy that I based Neil on

1522
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,814
was not someone
who committed suicide,

1523
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,900
but someone who was
a very close friend of mine

1524
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:53,570
when I was 11, 12, 13,
something like that.

1525
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:57,699
And- Who moved away from my town.
And when I-

1526
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,743
He was- Не and I were really close.

1527
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,663
And when I finally saw-
And he had a father

1528
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:05,207
very similar to Neil's father,
just terrifying.

1529
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:08,418
I remember spending the night over there,
just being terrified by his dad.

1530
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,296
And so stern, so straight.

1531
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:16,593
And when I connected with this guy
maybe 20 years later...

1532
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,179
He had been exceptional
at certain things.

1533
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:23,392
And I asked him, you know, "How-?
Are you still doing this? Still doing that?"

1534
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,601
And he said, "No. "

1535
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,813
I said, "Why not?"
And he said, "My dad made me stop. "

1536
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,691
I said, "Why?" He said, "It was getting
in the way of my studies. "

1537
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,944
And I just thought, "Oh, my God. "
He was- I mean, so talented.

1538
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:36,280
And I said:

1539
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,240
"And, you know,
what are you doing now?"

1540
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,951
By then he was doing
something fairly routine.

1541
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:44,413
He had not excelled in studies and had
given up the things he loved in his life.

1542
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:48,166
And I thought, "You know what?
He's- It's like he committed suicide. "

1543
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:53,088
And that was my image
for that character all along.

1544
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,341
So, yeah, he was gonna kill himself.

1545
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,303
Or his dad was gonna kill him.

1546
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:00,929
<i>Because I love teaching.</i>

1547
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,307
<i>/ don't wanna be anywhere else.</i>

1548
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:08,770
You know, I've sort of
stayed close with my high school friends

1549
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,564
since high school, really.

1550
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,567
And so I don't think they look at me
any different

1551
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:16,987
than they did.
Any differently than they did then.

1552
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:20,657
You know, they've all succeeded
at things too.

1553
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,951
So I think we just kind of all
had a sense that,

1554
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:26,455
yeah, this is where we all
expected to end up

1555
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,332
and, you know-

1556
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:34,254
Some people I'm not close with,
you know, sort of felt like:

1557
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,590
"Was that me in the movie?"
And, "Was that-?"

1558
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,927
And it was- That was a peculiar thing
to have people call up and go-

1559
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,513
You know, or hear
from the grapevine that so-and-so

1560
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,975
thought that some very minor character
was based on them

1561
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,477
and go, "My God.

1562
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,896
You know, if I've offended somebody,
I'm sorry,

1563
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:54,358
but that's not who I was thinking of, so-"
And either way they were offended.

1564
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:56,318
You know, they were offended
if I used them,

1565
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,613
and they were offended if I didn't, so...

1566
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,658
<i>That they're counting on me.</i>

1567
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,577
<i>He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind
for my own good.</i>

1568
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:09,414
<i>You are not an indentured servant.
If it's not a whim for you,</i>

1569
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:12,167
<i>you prove it to him
by your conviction and your passion.</i>

1570
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:14,753
<i>You show him that,
and if he still doesn't believe you,</i>

1571
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,881
<i>well, by then, you'll be out of school
and you can do anything you want.</i>

1572
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,510
<i>No.</i>

1573
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,806
<i>Just before making Dead Poets Society,</i>

1574
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:27,641
I was standing
in Jeff Katzenberg's office.

1575
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,477
It was his project.

1576
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,979
He was then at Disney.

1577
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:36,400
And I'd just returned from Europe,
very frustrated.

1578
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:40,028
I'd actually gone to Europe from his office,
where we'd shaken hands

1579
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,740
<i>on a little film, a little comedy I'd written
called Green Card.</i>

1580
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,659
It was only 75 pages long

1581
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,702
and I'd written it for Depardieu.

1582
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:51,289
And I said, "Jeff, will you back me
making this film? Yes or no?"

1583
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,582
Handshake, you know.

1584
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:56,086
Because I want to go to Paris
and see Gerard.

1585
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,421
"I don't know if he'll do it,

1586
01:26:57,587 --> 01:27:00,465
but I wanna be able to say to him,
'I have backing. "'

1587
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,217
Jeff said:

1588
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,886
"It's unconventional but okay. "
We shook hands in the office.

1589
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,389
I flew to Paris, met Gerard.

1590
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,641
Gerard said, "I'd like to do the movie. "

1591
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:12,352
And his agent said,
"But have you told Peter, Gerard?"

1592
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:14,062
And I said, "Told me what?" He said:

1593
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,649
"Well, Gerard, you know,
you're not available for one year. "

1594
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:21,445
So I said, "Okay, I'll wait for you
since I wrote it for you. "

1595
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,239
So I flew back through Jeffs office,
as it were.

1596
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,451
And he said, "What are you gonna do
for a year?" I said:

1597
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:31,746
"Well, I don't know. I'll work on the script,
you know, or something.

1598
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,416
And I can't really think what to do. "

1599
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,877
And he said, "Why don't you do
another film in between?"

1600
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:39,588
And I said,
"Oh, right, this is sort of 1938

1601
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,715
and you're gonna give me
an assignment, are you?"

1602
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:45,969
He said, "As a matter of fact, I am.
You know, read this on the plane. "

1603
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:48,054
So halfway across the Pacific-

1604
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,640
"What is it? Something boring?"
You know?

1605
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:53,268
<i>And I opened it and the title,
the Dead Poets Society,</i>

1606
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:54,811
immediately intrigued me.

1607
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,855
I thought, "What a great title.

1608
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,064
What is it?

1609
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,233
What are they? Who are they?"

1610
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,486
I have to read it to find out.

1611
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,988
I think I was back within six weeks.

1612
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,907
And shot it in between.

1613
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:10,160
And so it was like 1938 or something-
It was-

1614
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:15,707
What I'd always wanted was to
not spend always a great amount of time

1615
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,250
developing the thing.

1616
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:21,630
But, you know, to go and just shoot,
you know, like Mack Sennett did.

1617
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:23,715
<i>With hair and skin of gold</i>

1618
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,844
Yeah, yes, I think the oral tradition

1619
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:32,390
is probably, in some ways, more effective
than the written one with films.

1620
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,100
I think it's probably, therefore,

1621
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,561
as it were, better to tell the story
to somebody.

1622
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:39,064
They call it pitching.

1623
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:42,234
But the trouble with pitching
is that it's really not storytelling.

1624
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:46,488
It's trying to present it
more like a lawyer,

1625
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:50,242
the best case for your project.

1626
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:53,119
So people tend to allude to other films
and so forth.

1627
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:56,456
<i>You know, it's a kind of Butch Cassidy.
You know, that sort of thing.</i>

1628
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:59,543
<i>It's a little On the Waterfront, a little-</i>

1629
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:01,294
You know, it's horrible.

1630
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:05,298
But to really tell the story, as if it was-
You know, "Let me tell you a story.

1631
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:08,176
It was an evening,

1632
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,636
you know, in—

1633
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,222
I don't know, Uganda, you know.

1634
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:15,350
And the sunsets in Uganda
are remarkable.

1635
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:16,810
Quite distinctive. "

1636
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:19,771
You know, so that's storytelling, isn't it?
You know, it's sort of-

1637
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:22,774
You just have to put yourself there.

1638
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:25,610
So I did develop some of my-

1639
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:29,197
Right from the beginning of making
American films that I would tell the story

1640
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:33,034
to executives. That was Jeff Katzenberg

1641
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:37,372
and the Paramount group at the time.

1642
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,541
You know, you can do it
in about 10 minutes.

1643
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:43,169
And it's a very good thing
because you can find holes, actually,

1644
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:46,923
in the narrative that you didn't see
on paper.

1645
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,594
You know, you reach a point, to saying-
You could do this with your own children,

1646
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,471
which is also a very good storytelling trend
if you're making it up.

1647
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:58,560
"So at this point,
he decides to go back to Los Angeles.

1648
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:03,398
As he puts the key in the door of his house
on that evening,

1649
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:08,445
it suddenly occurs to him
that he should go in by the back door.

1650
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,947
For what reason, he had-

1651
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,282
To this day, does not know

1652
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,909
but he had to go in the back door. "
And I'm thinking,

1653
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,245
"I should have a reason
why he goes in the back door. "

1654
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,248
You know, that's interesting.
The other part of the brain is saying:

1655
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,376
"That's interesting, he goes through
the back door, not the front door,

1656
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:25,921
which is why he discovers
what he discovers.

1657
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,841
But why didn't he go through the front door
if he's got his key?

1658
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,302
Perhaps I should just have
a little linking scene

1659
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:34,888
or something that's mentioned earlier. "

1660
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:37,140
So very good storytelling.

1661
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:40,352
As much as I think taping a script's
very good.

1662
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,062
I live, you know, out of the town.

1663
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,564
You know,
so it's an hour drive to the city.

1664
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,067
So I'll tape it usually.

1665
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:49,194
Do all the voices.

1666
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:50,612
Like a radio show.

1667
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,573
And, you know,

1668
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,991
horses I've done, period film.

1669
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:56,951
You know, and you'd
sort of drum on the table.

1670
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,912
Drrrum, drrrum. You know, things like-

1671
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,538
I open doors. You know: Rrork.

1672
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,999
"Come in. " Heh, hen.

1673
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,043
I don't literally have the telephone ring.

1674
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,629
<i>Yeah, come on, guys.</i>

1675
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:09,839
<i>Chris, you can't be in here.</i>

1676
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:11,925
<i>If they catch you,
we're gonna be in trouble.</i>

1677
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,385
<i>- Come on.
- Oh, but it's fine-</i>

1678
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:14,928
<i>Chris.</i>

1679
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,640
<i>It's fine for you
to come into my school...?</i>

1680
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:21,184
I had another film pressing hard

1681
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:24,187
<i>on the back of Dead Poets Society.</i>

1682
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,815
As I mentioned though, I had

1683
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:30,318
to wait a year for Gerard Depardieu
and-

1684
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:34,614
You know, Jeff gave me this film
to make in the meantime,

1685
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:37,117
which I thought was ridiculous
that I would like.

1686
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:38,368
It was a joke, you know.

1687
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,578
I read hundreds of scripts, you know.

1688
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,415
And it was the one, I did.

1689
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,083
It happened just as he said.

1690
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:49,212
So I made it within that year,
as it were, and we've all finished,

1691
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:51,423
and then had to go on
to what was a commitment.

1692
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:55,677
<i>Wanted to. Gerard was free
and I moved on to Green Card.</i>

1693
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:58,930
Shooting in New York. And in fact, couldn't
get across to the Academy Awards

1694
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,015
without stopping shooting.

1695
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:06,271
And felt Tom Schulman
represented us there.

1696
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,647
And...

1697
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:08,898
<i>Then come with me.</i>

1698
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,650
... Robin.

1699
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:13,611
And so we were watching it on TV.

1700
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,530
A lot of the boys came,
a lot of the poets.

1701
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:19,367
We watched it in New York.

1702
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,618
<i>You come with me tonight,</i>

1703
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,246
<i>then if you don't wanna see me again,
I swear, I'll bow out.</i>

1704
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,957
<i>You know what would happen
if Chet found out?</i>

1705
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:27,751
<i>He won't know anything.</i>

1706
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,920
<i>We'll sit in the back and sneak away
as soon as it's over.</i>

1707
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:34,758
<i>And I suppose you would promise
that this would be the end of it.</i>

1708
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,176
<i>Dead Poets' honor.</i>

1709
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:37,927
<i>What is that?</i>

1710
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,473
<i>My word.</i>

1711
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:56,988
<i>You are so infuriating.</i>

1712
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:20,804
<i>- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, hey, hey.</i>

1713
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,890
It's funny
because I had been back in Los Angeles

1714
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:30,522
and when I flew back to Delaware,
they had shifted into nights

1715
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,065
and they were doing this scene.

1716
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:33,858
And I remember walking
into the theater.

1717
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,487
Peter was as exhausted
as I've ever seen a human being,

1718
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,405
looked just scary exhausted.

1719
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:43,910
You know, walking
but with his eyes almost closed

1720
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:47,122
while he was walking around.
And they were struggling

1721
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:50,708
<i>to put this little play,
the Midsummer Night's Dream up,</i>

1722
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:54,003
and Peter walked up to me and said,
"Oh, Tom, Tom, glad you're back.

1723
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,339
By the way, they just sent this-

1724
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:58,633
Your script to this place
called Barbara's Place

1725
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,093
where they retyped it

1726
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,679
and apparently, it's not 130 pages long.

1727
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,848
It's 170 pages long.

1728
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:07,767
So we're gonna have to take 40 pages
out of the script. "

1729
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:12,856
And I said, "Peter, we're two-thirds
of the way through shooting.

1730
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:17,485
I mean, if we're gonna take 40 pages out-
We barely have 40 pages left to shoot. "

1731
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:20,071
And he goes,
"I know. Well, you figure it out

1732
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,532
and let me know what to do and I'll-"

1733
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:25,994
And then he just laid down on the floor
and fell asleep.

1734
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,746
And I thought, "Okay, this is fine.

1735
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:31,749
When he's awake, it'll be all right. "

1736
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,210
Then I heard somebody,
"Peter, we're ready to shoot. "

1737
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:36,546
And he kind of woke up,
just jumped up right away

1738
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:39,382
and said, "Oh, okay, you over there
and you'd move here.

1739
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:40,884
So-and-so, would you like to-?"

1740
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:43,720
You know, he just woke
out of a dead sleep directing.

1741
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,096
It was great.

1742
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:49,475
And he put the scene up and it worked.
And then he kind of sat back in the chair

1743
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:52,145
and his head fell back
and he fell back to sleep.

1744
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:55,773
And I thought, "This is just the greatest.

1745
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:58,318
You know, the nightmare of directing. "

1746
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:04,449
But literally just, you know, almost
directing in his sleep, I suppose.

1747
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:10,038
<i>Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;</i>

1748
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:12,332
<i>Neil. That's your cue, Neil.</i>

1749
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:13,583
<i>Come on, Neil.</i>

1750
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,668
The days
that I was on the set, we would shoot

1751
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:18,755
and then we'd go back to his trailer
at 5, 6:00 in the evening

1752
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:22,008
and there would be all these messages
from the studio about various things.

1753
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:24,427
The Legal Department needs this
and so forth and so on.

1754
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:26,262
And absolutely, they would-

1755
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:28,848
Someone would have done that
and realized that the script-

1756
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:31,309
Because I cheated
on the length of the script

1757
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:32,810
when I got done with it.

1758
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:36,564
By my computer's calculations,
it was about 150 pages.

1759
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:40,652
I knew that was unacceptable so I just
thought, "Well, I can squeeze it down. "

1760
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:43,571
So I just went through
and took as many words out as I could

1761
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,991
and crushed it all together,
and then forgot about it.

1762
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,409
You know, and-

1763
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:51,746
So years later,
when people thought-

1764
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:53,873
I think I got it down to 129 pages,

1765
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:57,585
that length that wouldn't,
you know, set off the alarm bells.

1766
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,005
And as we did rewrites,
it ballooned up to 130, 135.

1767
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,716
But it was never a real problem.

1768
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:07,387
But had they known
that it was actually 150,

1769
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:11,140
or by what he said, 170 pages,
they would have just reamed us.

1770
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,017
They would-
Before they started shooting,

1771
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:16,020
they would have said, "Sit down
and take 50 pages out of the script. "

1772
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:19,816
And see whole scenes that we wanted
to shoot would have just gone.

1773
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:21,776
So to a certain extent,

1774
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:25,154
we were lucky that no one checked
until about halfway through the production.

1775
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:29,450
And they may have checked because,
you know, the days were running longer.

1776
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:33,496
Who knows? I have no idea why,
but it happened, so...

1777
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,460
I think nowadays, they would check.

1778
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:42,755
They would check
before you started shooting.

1779
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:48,177
And so I think studios have become
much more page-conscious now

1780
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:52,223
than they used to be
because pages are money.

1781
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,392
<i>Else the Puck a liar call;</i>

1782
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,730
The first cut of the movie was terrifying.

1783
01:36:58,896 --> 01:36:59,939
I didn't see that cut.

1784
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:04,527
Peter called me from Australia
and said, "Well, it's 2:46."

1785
01:37:04,694 --> 01:37:06,279
And I said, "Okay. "

1786
01:37:06,446 --> 01:37:08,906
And then overnight, I thought,
"Okay, he can cut this scene.

1787
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:11,075
That's six minutes.
And this scene and this scene. "

1788
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,870
And I called in the next day
and I said, "I have three scenes. "

1789
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:15,788
He said, "This one? This one?"
I said, "Yup. "

1790
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:17,623
He said, "That's the ones. They're out. "

1791
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,335
So that got it down to about 2:16
or something,

1792
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,587
and some little trims, and that was it,
you know?

1793
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:26,549
They were two of the scenes
that I had to beg him to shoot anyway,

1794
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:28,009
so it was-

1795
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:29,802
I knew they were going out.

1796
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:31,846
The boys getting their assignments.

1797
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:34,098
There's the scene of the-

1798
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:37,935
The waterfall and then the one other.
What was the other one?

1799
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:39,520
Oh, and then the scene where-

1800
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:42,148
There were two classroom scenes
that I think were cut.

1801
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:45,193
One where Keating teaches the boys
to review the book

1802
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,986
that they have never read.

1803
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:48,404
And one other,

1804
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:50,865
a really quick one.

1805
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:52,992
Kind of in the same vein.

1806
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:57,121
Well, the scene where he teaches them
how to review the books

1807
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,790
is about eight or nine minutes long.

1808
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,458
I mean, that requires some-

1809
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:04,504
You have to know enough about the book
that you haven't read,

1810
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,964
that they haven't read

1811
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:08,925
to understand how it happens.

1812
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:11,761
So it's a— You know, it's a lot of scene.

1813
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:13,221
It's too much scene.

1814
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:17,308
The waterfall was probably
about six or eight, 10 minutes.

1815
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:23,523
And then the scene- The first early scene
was about seven, eight minutes.

1816
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:26,859
And then there were little trims
here and there that got it down.

1817
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,788
<i>Excuse me, please. Excuse me.</i>

1818
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:42,291
<i>- Excuse me, please.
- Neil. Neil.</i>

1819
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:45,253
<i>- Neil.
- We love you, wait.</i>

1820
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,422
<i>- / can't, guys.
- Neil.</i>

1821
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,799
<i>- Neil.
- Excuse me.</i>

1822
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,803
<i>Neil. Neil. You have the gift.</i>

1823
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,014
<i>What a performance.
You left even me speechless.</i>

1824
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,683
<i>- You have to stay-
PERRY: Get in the car.</i>

1825
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:01,978
<i>Keating, you stay away from my son.</i>

1826
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:06,858
<i>Neil. Neil. Mr. Perry, come on.</i>

1827
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:09,277
<i>Don't make it any worse than it is.</i>

1828
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:23,916
<i>Is it okay if we walk back?</i>

1829
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:26,127
<i>Captain?</i>

1830
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,465
<i>Knox.</i>

1831
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:36,220
<i>- ВО У 2: We'll be home about 11:30 still.
- I know where he gets it.</i>

1832
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,935
I worked very hard to make sure

1833
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:45,480
this film did not in any sense
condone the suicide.

1834
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:48,649
Rang a psychiatrist, discussed it,
sent the script.

1835
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:51,819
And I said, "How can I make it clear

1836
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:55,323
that this is his decision
and that it's wrong?"

1837
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:58,701
So, you know, I would never like
to think someone killed themselves

1838
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:02,246
if they saw it and were
in a similar mood as this boy.

1839
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:06,000
The psychiatrist said, "Yes, you must do
one thing. You must show his weakness.

1840
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:09,629
You must show that. You must be clearer
than you've got it in the script

1841
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:13,174
that the father when he asks him
to speak:

1842
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,843
Tell me what you're thinking,'

1843
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,639
that the boy is too weak to reply. "

1844
01:40:19,805 --> 01:40:25,561
And so I framed the camera up highish
and had Neil sit into his chair,

1845
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,481
as you see him

1846
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:30,233
do in the scene.

1847
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:32,235
And he looks weak,
and I asked him to do that

1848
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:33,986
which he did very effectively.

1849
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,989
And looks to Mom. Mommy.

1850
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,116
He's not a strong man.

1851
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:42,328
He's not- He can't- He's got a flaw.

1852
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:44,622
And the father's exasperated by it,
which is awful.

1853
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:48,376
You know, the father's, I don't think cruel.
He's just an old-fashioned type of father.

1854
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,294
You know, my father was like that.

1855
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:53,881
Fathers were like that in the '50s.
These men had been to war.

1856
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,759
You know, they'd shot people
and been in bombing runs.

1857
01:40:56,926 --> 01:40:58,511
Whatever. They had seen terrible things

1858
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:00,846
and they thought their children
should be grateful

1859
01:41:01,013 --> 01:41:04,308
for what they were giving them,
education.

1860
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:12,692
<i>Is it more of this-?
This acting business?</i>

1861
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:15,653
<i>Because you can forget that.</i>

1862
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:19,073
<i>What?</i>

1863
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,746
<i>Nothing.</i>

1864
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:28,791
The suicide scene
and the whole sequence leading up to it

1865
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,168
was meant to be-
Was written to be intercut

1866
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:37,258
with a sequence where
Keating leads the other boys

1867
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,260
in a walk through the woods.

1868
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:43,014
And... Sort of in a celebration

1869
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:46,809
of the theater that night,
for Neil's triumph in the theater

1870
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:51,022
and Knox's newfound success with Chris,
the girl he's in love with, and so forth.

1871
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:53,608
And it just-

1872
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,109
It may have worked on the page,

1873
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:57,862
I'm not sure, but it certainly didn't work
in the movie and it-

1874
01:41:58,029 --> 01:41:59,947
And I think we also-

1875
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:03,826
There was a frozen waterfall
in that sequence

1876
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:06,203
which turned out not looking
quite as good.

1877
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,581
The frozen ice turned yellow

1878
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:11,250
so it was an unpleasant-looking
frozen waterfall.

1879
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:14,211
So for various reasons,
that scene was cut out.

1880
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:19,091
And so what we're left with
is this sequence of Neil with his parents

1881
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:20,635
and then the suicide.

1882
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,304
And I think the whole

1883
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:26,015
sort of style of it, the visuals of it,

1884
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:29,685
the crown of thorns,

1885
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:32,563
which came from the character of Puck
onstage

1886
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,399
but of course,
has the obvious Christ reference too,

1887
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:40,196
all came from Peter in the business
of the slow motion.

1888
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:43,699
And not hearing the shot
and then his father just seeing that smoke

1889
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:47,745
next to the desk
versus him seeing the body,

1890
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:53,084
I think was again, all Peter's stuff,
and just worked great, I thought.

1891
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:56,921
Just more shocking
than if you'd seen these things

1892
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:59,298
in a much more conventional way.

1893
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:16,649
Yes, there was a big scene

1894
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:19,151
on the frozen waterfall.

1895
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:23,072
And we went to great trouble to-
Special effects.

1896
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:27,034
To, you know, make it look like
it was frozen, ice frozen.

1897
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:30,955
It's always intriguing
to see frozen water, I think.

1898
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:36,669
And Keating led them in a meeting
of the Dead Poets Society after Neil's-

1899
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:40,589
After his father had taken him away
at the end of the play.

1900
01:43:40,756 --> 01:43:42,675
But it was

1901
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:44,802
not believable

1902
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:49,432
and it was wrong to bring Keating
that closely in association with him.

1903
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:53,018
I mean, there's a lot I could say
about Keating.

1904
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:57,356
There's another scene I shot
which I just couldn't get working.

1905
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:02,153
Keating was devastated
by the death of Neil.

1906
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:05,865
And I felt that

1907
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:10,494
all his interest in the Dead Poets Society,
all his way of teaching was gone.

1908
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:13,372
It would take him years to come back to it,
if he ever did.

1909
01:44:13,539 --> 01:44:16,667
The only thing that is of great help
to that man

1910
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:19,003
is that the boys stand up for him.

1911
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,840
I think without that, he could be,
you know, in some ways,

1912
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:26,510
you know,
headed for pretty severe depression.

1913
01:44:26,844 --> 01:44:30,306
Because he would blame himself.
He was a sensitive man.

1914
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,975
So I did expand it a bit.
We just quickly wrote a scene

1915
01:44:33,142 --> 01:44:38,481
and I had Robin do it there with Mac,
the other teacher,

1916
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:41,233
in which Robin talks about,

1917
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:45,070
you know, the fact that this creativity
that he had in the classroom

1918
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:49,450
has really caused the death maybe
of this boy.

1919
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:52,870
And he felt responsible. And of course
he's reassured by the other teacher.

1920
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:54,497
"There are suicides at school,"

1921
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:56,290
he says. "It happens all the time.

1922
01:44:56,457 --> 01:44:59,043
Everyone's been at schools
where there's been a suicide. "

1923
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,212
And generally,
they're rather tragically,

1924
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:04,548
seemingly things that could have been
sorted out, you know.

1925
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:09,220
If only- If only they'd talked, you know.

1926
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:11,806
If only I could have helped him, but...

1927
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,849
So don't blame yourself.
But anyway, so you-

1928
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:16,602
I really asked Robin
and Robin understood

1929
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:21,273
to play this heavily weighed down,
blaming himself.

1930
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,777
And then when he says to the boys
at the end of the film:

1931
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:30,533
"Thank you, boys. Thank you"
to their gesture,

1932
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:36,705
he really means, "Thank you
for giving me a reason to go on. "

1933
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,792
And so anything
that was going to deflect that truth,

1934
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:43,963
anything with him meeting them
and so on was really wrong

1935
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:46,715
because it was complicit.

1936
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,052
He wasn't a revolutionary.

1937
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:53,556
He wasn't а '60s man, Keating.

1938
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:57,434
He's a much older man, really.
A much older type of teacher.

1939
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:02,273
Maybe a little theatrical but he was-
It was to inspire.

1940
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:05,401
It wasn't to change your life
so that you dropped out,

1941
01:46:05,568 --> 01:46:07,278
you know, like the '60s.

1942
01:46:07,444 --> 01:46:10,823
Or that you were inspired
to go and change society.

1943
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:14,785
It was simply saying, "Whatever you do,
you can enrich your life by opening a book

1944
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:18,455
or going to a play or a film. "

1945
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:23,127
That there's more than the material lives
that we lead.

1946
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:25,045
<i>What is it?</i>

1947
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,632
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1948
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:30,467
My defense of the two deaths

1949
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:35,389
was that even though you would never see
the Keating character die,

1950
01:46:35,556 --> 01:46:39,184
it in some way prepared you
for Neil's character's death.

1951
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:43,355
And suddenly the boys would have
something else to be dealing with.

1952
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:46,817
You know, a certain kind of conscious
and subconscious preoccupation

1953
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:48,611
with their teacher's mortality.

1954
01:46:48,777 --> 01:46:50,946
So that for Neil,

1955
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:57,411
joining his teacher in the afterlife
or at least seeing himself like his teacher

1956
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:59,622
and therefore better prepared for death
would-

1957
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:06,086
Might have made the suicide even,
you know, perhaps more predictable,

1958
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:09,590
but maybe more palatable too.

1959
01:47:10,299 --> 01:47:12,217
Peter's point,
and I think it was a good one,

1960
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:16,096
was that if you see those boys stand up

1961
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,224
for a man they know is dying,

1962
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:24,271
then it just doesn't have the same power
as if they're standing up for his ideas.

1963
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,607
Anybody would stand up for a person

1964
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:32,404
who's sort of got the courage to continue,
struggle with life if they're dying.

1965
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:35,491
But if it's simply because
you believe in what they've taught you,

1966
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:38,702
then it's a whole different thing.

1967
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:40,579
So aside from any other consideration,

1968
01:47:40,746 --> 01:47:43,957
I think that was a good reason
to change it.

1969
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:53,968
<i>Todd?</i>

1970
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:58,430
<i>- Todd.
- Oh, Charlie.</i>

1971
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:07,231
<i>What is it?</i>

1972
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,617
<i>Neil's dead.</i>

1973
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:31,422
The scene was originally set-

1974
01:48:31,588 --> 01:48:34,425
Was originally set in the bathroom.

1975
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:39,513
We'd already done a scene in the
bathroom, so on the way to the location,

1976
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:41,682
Peter turned around, he said:

1977
01:48:41,849 --> 01:48:44,810
"Johnny, we gotta set it in the snow"
because it kept snowing.

1978
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:46,729
And I said, "Right on. Let's go. "

1979
01:48:46,895 --> 01:48:51,984
So we shot what we could
and without leaving footprints.

1980
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:56,363
But when it came to the scene in the snow
where Ethan Hawke

1981
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,990
was being sick in the snow,

1982
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:00,325
we actually set it up and shot it,

1983
01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:01,744
and Peter wanted take two.

1984
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:05,205
So we moved the whole camera
and all of the crew forward

1985
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:06,790
10 feet into new snow

1986
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:08,542
and then just said to the boys:

1987
01:49:08,709 --> 01:49:10,753
"Run down, do the same thing
in front of the camera.

1988
01:49:10,919 --> 01:49:12,379
There's no marks, there's nothing. "

1989
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,965
And the boys-
We did it three times, I think.

1990
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:16,967
And it was fantastic.

1991
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:19,303
It was a fantastic thing to do,
to put it in the snow.

1992
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:21,055
And when Ethan finally runs off,

1993
01:49:21,513 --> 01:49:24,224
we were able to then
pan him off through-

1994
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,143
You know,
and he ran through virgin snow

1995
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,729
all the way down to the wharf
on the lake's edge.

1996
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:31,231
And I think it added so much to the film

1997
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:34,151
to be able to put the boys
out into that situation

1998
01:49:34,318 --> 01:49:38,155
that had just occurred
on the way to work, basically.

1999
01:49:38,322 --> 01:49:43,869
And Peter and the boys, the actors,
were quite ready and prepared to adapt

2000
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:48,540
and just make the best
of what we had there.

2001
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:51,585
And it doesn't matter
what happens in preparation

2002
01:49:51,752 --> 01:49:54,963
and all the thinking and anticipation
that you think you can do.

2003
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:56,882
There's always something nice
that happens.

2004
01:49:57,049 --> 01:49:59,718
And if, as a crew, say,

2005
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:03,472
and Peter, you know,
is ready, obviously,

2006
01:50:03,639 --> 01:50:05,682
and the actors can adapt quickly,

2007
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:08,727
I think you can end up
with some amazing stuff.

2008
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:33,293
I think in every situation
in the making of a movie,

2009
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:37,589
I feel the question has to be asked,
you know:

2010
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:41,218
Where are we doing the next shot
and why?

2011
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:43,387
And that's what I ask myself, you know.

2012
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:46,890
Why is the camera going here
and what size is it?

2013
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,767
Because, you know, we all know

2014
01:50:48,934 --> 01:50:52,521
that except for the first shot of a film
and the last shot of the film,

2015
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:55,941
every other shot comes out of another
shot and goes into another shot,

2016
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:58,402
so it must flow in the final edit.

2017
01:50:58,569 --> 01:51:01,655
And Peter particularly
is very, very aware of that,

2018
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:04,324
apropos of his Moviola in the brain.

2019
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:09,788
And so by trying to bring an emotion
to a scene,

2020
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:14,084
it's very crucial as to where you put
the camera and why.

2021
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,919
You know, why is it this far back?

2022
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:18,088
Is it gonna show the empty room?

2023
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:21,508
The boys have gone.
He feels that he's failed.

2024
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:26,513
And that the empty room means that,
you know, it hasn't worked.

2025
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:32,144
His Dead Poets Society
has actually caused more pain

2026
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:33,604
than it should have.

2027
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:35,647
It should have been a beautiful release.

2028
01:51:35,814 --> 01:51:38,942
So that, you know,
by showing emptiness around him

2029
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:41,320
and then cutting into the close-up

2030
01:51:41,486 --> 01:51:44,865
to then, you know, dot the I on the pain
that he's going through

2031
01:51:45,032 --> 01:51:47,534
seemed to be the logical way to do it.

2032
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:52,539
But it's not to say that couldn't have been
a long lens in a different situation.

2033
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:55,751
And I think that it's,
why are you using that lens

2034
01:51:55,918 --> 01:52:02,215
to portray or to help enhance
a certain emotional moment?

2035
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:06,845
It is generally decided for each situation

2036
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:11,975
rather than a set.
You know, a 30, a 35 lens might be,

2037
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:16,021
you know, an emotional lens,
say, that does this.

2038
01:52:16,188 --> 01:52:17,272
Any lens will do it.

2039
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:19,858
It's how and where you put it.

2040
01:52:20,025 --> 01:52:24,821
And how it cuts in to the one in front
and the one behind as a flow.

2041
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:29,076
I must say I'm very conscious

2042
01:52:29,243 --> 01:52:34,122
of what's in the background,
what's in the foreground and why.

2043
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:35,832
Some people dress the foreground

2044
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,669
for the sake of dressing the foreground.
I don't agree with that.

2045
01:52:38,835 --> 01:52:43,173
I think that, you know, the foreground
and the background should be selected.

2046
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:47,219
Therefore deciding on the angle
of the camera

2047
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:51,264
for its background value
to that moment.

2048
01:52:52,391 --> 01:52:55,477
It might not have the door in shot
because the door is escape.

2049
01:52:55,644 --> 01:52:58,981
It can- It's a way out or it's a way in.

2050
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:01,066
So maybe you'd prefer
not to show the door.

2051
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:03,443
Just move the camera a little bit.

2052
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:06,530
There's a million things
that you could analyze in the frame

2053
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:08,240
either in background or foreground.

2054
01:53:08,407 --> 01:53:13,453
You know, and Peter's very interesting
in this way.

2055
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:19,793
<i>- You told him about this meeting?
- Twice.</i>

2056
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,212
<i>That's it, guys. We're all fried.</i>

2057
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:25,007
<i>- How do you mean?
- Cameron's a fink.</i>

2058
01:53:25,173 --> 01:53:28,302
<i>- He's in Nolan's office right now, finking.
- About what?</i>

2059
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:29,928
I love small spaces.

2060
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:33,890
There's- Often on films, you know, people
will say, "Oh, this room is too small.

2061
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:37,644
We can't shoot in there. "
And I look at it and I think, "Yes, we can. "

2062
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,939
Being, I think, a realist cameraman,

2063
01:53:41,106 --> 01:53:45,694
I hate taking walls out even though
they're available on a stage set.

2064
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:51,324
Because deep down
I have this feeling that for the actor,

2065
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:54,244
if you take a wall out,
that means it's a set.

2066
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:56,830
And it's not- We're not real anymore.

2067
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,999
But even on a stage set,

2068
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:01,251
if you leave the walls in,

2069
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:07,090
somehow I feel that the actor
can then relate to it as being real.

2070
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:11,845
As soon as the wall comes out,
you can see people on set.

2071
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:14,556
You can see, you know,
you're in another room.

2072
01:54:14,723 --> 01:54:17,934
And that I feel I like to try and avoid.

2073
01:54:18,101 --> 01:54:24,608
I love trying to use the room as the room
and make the camera fit in that room.

2074
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:28,612
Because often as not you'll find
if you can take a wall out,

2075
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:33,784
then you can put the camera
6 feet further back in that room

2076
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:37,496
than it could ever, ever in reality be.

2077
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:41,625
And that gives you angles in the room
that aren't real.

2078
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:48,381
And I feel that in all honesty
that an audience

2079
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:50,550
is aware of perspective.

2080
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:55,430
Whether they could ever explain it to you,
back to you or not, doesn't matter.

2081
01:54:55,597 --> 01:54:58,642
I think they're aware of perspective
of a room.

2082
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:03,605
And that if suddenly you put
a wide-angle lens 6 feet through a wall

2083
01:55:03,772 --> 01:55:06,233
to get a wide shot in a room,

2084
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:11,238
I honestly believe they subconsciously feel
that's not right.

2085
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:13,490
You couldn't get that.

2086
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:17,953
And therefore it makes it a movie
and takes it out of this reality.

2087
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,580
So that I always try and-

2088
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:22,541
Try and shoot movies

2089
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:25,836
so that you're in the room,
the camera is in the room

2090
01:55:26,002 --> 01:55:29,422
and therefore the perspective is correct.

2091
01:55:30,215 --> 01:55:32,426
And I think in the cave

2092
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:35,846
<i>and in the dorm rooms
of Dead Poets Society,</i>

2093
01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:40,851
I think we've gone for that
as much as possible.

2094
01:55:41,059 --> 01:55:43,603
Even though, you know,
we did take walls out.

2095
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:48,316
But I still try then to make the camera feel
as though it's inside the room

2096
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:50,819
as a subconscious thing.

2097
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:52,696
It's not outside the room.

2098
01:55:52,863 --> 01:55:54,114
And I think that-

2099
01:55:54,781 --> 01:56:00,036
<i>I think Peter is very aware of that
and was on Dead Poets Society,</i>

2100
01:56:00,203 --> 01:56:03,081
that the whole thing is reality driven.

2101
01:56:03,248 --> 01:56:08,670
That the boys are in their space
of that college, of the rooms, of the cave

2102
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:10,881
and even traveling to the cave.

2103
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:15,051
And we tried to keep that
as real as possible,

2104
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:17,053
even though we were using sets.

2105
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:21,850
And I think- As I said,
"You learn something from every film. "

2106
01:56:22,017 --> 01:56:24,477
And I think that over the years
I have learned that.

2107
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:27,981
And I feel that it is right
that you have to keep and maintain

2108
01:56:28,148 --> 01:56:30,567
that subconscious reality.

2109
01:56:30,734 --> 01:56:37,199
But also as I said earlier, I think too
that an actor feels possibly the same.

2110
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:41,328
That when the wall comes out,
it's a set.

2111
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:44,956
But if that wall doesn't come out and
the camera's squashed in the corner,

2112
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:48,001
and the operator's really scrunched
in the corner

2113
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:53,089
trying to get the shot as wide as he can
but it's still within the confines of that area,

2114
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:56,259
and the wall hasn't come out,
it's still a four-walled room,

2115
01:56:56,426 --> 01:57:03,141
that the actor then subconsciously,
I really believe, will feel that he's in reality

2116
01:57:03,308 --> 01:57:05,477
and can give a performance
that suits that.

2117
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:07,145
So they're only little things.

2118
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:09,314
They're only very small things,

2119
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:12,567
but I think that all those small things
add up so that-

2120
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:13,944
I'm not frightened of it.

2121
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:17,197
In fact, I often push very hard

2122
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:19,491
to convince directors that:

2123
01:57:19,658 --> 01:57:23,828
"No, we can make this whole scene
work in this room. " But they-

2124
01:57:23,995 --> 01:57:25,830
They may be used to somebody else
who says:

2125
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,750
"Oh, no. The wall's gotta come out
and the roof's gotta come off

2126
01:57:28,917 --> 01:57:30,710
and this and that and the other thing. "

2127
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:34,923
And suddenly it's not a reality anymore.
It is a set.

2128
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:38,677
So I try to go up against that
as best I can.

2129
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:41,346
<i>- Hello, son.
- Hello, darling.</i>

2130
01:57:43,556 --> 01:57:45,183
<i>Mom.</i>

2131
01:57:46,476 --> 01:57:48,562
I remember when I was writing it,

2132
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:50,772
trying to decide
whether Todd would sign,

2133
01:57:50,939 --> 01:57:54,526
it was painful for me to think
that this kid would have to sign it.

2134
01:57:54,693 --> 01:57:58,989
And I think that in several versions,
he didn't sign.

2135
01:57:59,155 --> 01:58:02,033
And as I recall though,

2136
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,453
it seemed pretty obvious
that if the kids didn't sign,

2137
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:08,081
they wouldn't be in that room,
in that classroom, at the end.

2138
01:58:08,248 --> 01:58:10,500
Because if you didn't sign,
you were gonna be expelled.

2139
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:15,588
So I think Peter may have solved it
by not actually seeing Todd sign it.

2140
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:18,174
I think he just cut away
and we know he signed,

2141
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:21,553
but we don't have to go through
the painful experience of watching him

2142
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:24,389
sign that paper.

2143
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:26,308
<i>It describes how your teacher,
Mr. Keating...</i>

2144
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:31,479
The emotion that the viewer contributes

2145
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:36,318
that joins with the emotion coming from
or sentiment from the filmmaker

2146
01:58:36,484 --> 01:58:39,279
is the great meeting.

2147
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:43,408
And therefore if you-
Rather than being didactic as a filmmaker,

2148
01:58:43,575 --> 01:58:46,328
you know, you simply present
your story,

2149
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:51,666
and then the audience member comes
towards you and forward and joins you,

2150
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:55,837
the experience is greater than you,
you know, could have made it

2151
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:58,882
if you just made a propaganda film.

2152
01:58:59,049 --> 01:59:01,718
Selling something,
it's like an advertisement.

2153
01:59:01,885 --> 01:59:03,637
You know,
where the film is open enough.

2154
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:07,182
Now, to do that, you're gonna lose
some people. "I don't get what it's about.

2155
01:59:07,349 --> 01:59:10,101
It's kind of sort of nothing,
you know?

2156
01:59:10,268 --> 01:59:11,561
It was boring. "

2157
01:59:11,728 --> 01:59:13,313
But the other person says,
"Oh, no.

2158
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:17,859
That was just that it wasn't hitting you in
the head all the time like a lot of films do. "

2159
01:59:18,026 --> 01:59:21,196
You have to think about it.
If you got into it, if you get into the thing,

2160
01:59:21,363 --> 01:59:24,115
then you can have
a very rich experience.

2161
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:28,411
And consequently, very small things
can become very big

2162
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:31,289
for the person who is joined to the film,

2163
01:59:32,207 --> 01:59:33,667
as you say the moment

2164
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:37,045
that Keating looks out his window
toward the end there

2165
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:40,298
with his career in ruins really.

2166
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:45,136
And his friend down there,
the Latin teacher, Mac, is walking...

2167
01:59:45,303 --> 01:59:48,473
Peacock-hacking with a bunch
of young- Younger students.

2168
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,849
His job is going on

2169
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:53,812
and he looks up. And the shared
wave between them I think is...

2170
01:59:54,354 --> 01:59:56,606
Well, you know, up to the viewer.

2171
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:57,941
But I think you can-

2172
01:59:58,108 --> 02:00:00,610
You know, you can imagine both men
and their sentiment.

2173
02:00:00,777 --> 02:00:02,362
You can hear what they must have-

2174
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:05,573
Would have said to each other
if they'd had a chance to.

2175
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:11,746
It's redolent with all sorts of things

2176
02:00:12,539 --> 02:00:13,581
that are only suggested.

2177
02:00:21,089 --> 02:00:22,090
<i>Sit.</i>

2178
02:00:22,257 --> 02:00:24,300
Taking the- In my original idea,

2179
02:00:24,467 --> 02:00:28,930
we were gonna be forced to attend
this kind of honor court

2180
02:00:29,097 --> 02:00:30,348
or tribunal at the school.

2181
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:33,518
And I had imagined each of them
being forced to...

2182
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:36,813
To get up and testify
about what Keating had done

2183
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:38,857
and various things he had taught
the classroom

2184
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:41,693
that sort of went against the grain
of what the school stood for.

2185
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:46,239
And that they would each sort of struggle
somehow to make a statement

2186
02:00:46,406 --> 02:00:48,283
to defend their teacher.

2187
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:52,370
And of course, that part of the statement
wouldn't be allowed.

2188
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:59,169
I remember sort of being
with my characters in their pews.

2189
02:00:59,335 --> 02:01:01,963
You know,
and watching the proceedings

2190
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:05,884
and watching Keating being sentenced
somehow, you know.

2191
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,844
And this was all very vague.

2192
02:01:08,011 --> 02:01:13,183
What court would this be?
It wouldn't have any real sort of weight.

2193
02:01:13,349 --> 02:01:16,352
And then I remember one of them
just standing up on the pew-

2194
02:01:16,519 --> 02:01:18,438
That's how it happened.
He stood up on the pew.

2195
02:01:18,605 --> 02:01:23,401
And I thought, "Well, okay.
Now they don't have to say anything.

2196
02:01:23,568 --> 02:01:27,113
That's the repeat of that early gesture
that he made. "

2197
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:34,329
So then I quickly moved it into
the classroom and wrote it as it is here,

2198
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:36,414
as it is in the movie.

2199
02:01:37,582 --> 02:01:40,627
<i>Gentlemen, turn to page 21
of the introduction.</i>

2200
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,379
<i>Mr. Cameron,</i>

2201
02:01:44,506 --> 02:01:48,801
<i>read aloud the excellent essay
by Dr. Pritchard...</i>

2202
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:50,303
Yeah, the end scene

2203
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:52,514
where the boys stand
on the desks at the end

2204
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:55,266
and stand up and be counted

2205
02:01:55,433 --> 02:01:57,644
for the Robin Williams character,

2206
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:59,729
we set that up in preproduction.

2207
02:01:59,896 --> 02:02:03,733
Because Peter wanted to know
where the boys would be

2208
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:05,818
at the end of the film.

2209
02:02:05,985 --> 02:02:08,446
And so then we knew
where their desks were

2210
02:02:08,613 --> 02:02:11,825
and then we had to go back
and try and work out the entire film

2211
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:13,076
inside the classroom.

2212
02:02:13,243 --> 02:02:15,119
That if the boys sat down,

2213
02:02:15,286 --> 02:02:17,288
that that's where they would be
in the classroom

2214
02:02:17,455 --> 02:02:19,290
for all the other scenes
in the classroom.

2215
02:02:19,457 --> 02:02:25,088
So it was a very, very calculated
positioning of the boys within that room

2216
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:27,131
and it all hinged on the end shot,

2217
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:30,260
which I thought was interesting.

2218
02:02:30,426 --> 02:02:34,597
It was also interesting in the lighting
that when they did stand up

2219
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:37,183
that Ethan Hawke
was the one who stood up

2220
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:41,104
right beside a practical lamp
that was hanging down.

2221
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:44,148
And it was the gaffer
who raised up to me and he said:

2222
02:02:44,315 --> 02:02:47,318
"He's too hot there
but I can pull that back. "

2223
02:02:47,485 --> 02:02:49,487
And I said, "No, don't.
Don't do it, Normy.

2224
02:02:49,654 --> 02:02:55,827
Because if he's overexposed,
he's the one who caused the shift.

2225
02:02:55,994 --> 02:02:58,246
He's the one who changed. "

2226
02:02:58,413 --> 02:03:05,086
And so therefore his face is lit very bright
on one side and darker on the other,

2227
02:03:05,253 --> 02:03:07,255
and that's the two sides of him.

2228
02:03:07,422 --> 02:03:10,758
And Normy was beside himself with worry
until we saw dailies.

2229
02:03:10,925 --> 02:03:13,761
And he said, "Oh, no. It looked good. "

2230
02:03:13,928 --> 02:03:16,055
And I quite like that.
That when he stood up,

2231
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:18,725
he was the one who had,

2232
02:03:18,891 --> 02:03:23,563
you know, the two shades on his face,
light and dark.

2233
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:25,315
<i>О Captain! my Captain!</i>

2234
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:28,401
<i>Sit down, Mr. Anderson.</i>

2235
02:03:30,194 --> 02:03:32,572
<i>Do you hear me? Sit down.</i>

2236
02:03:33,281 --> 02:03:35,366
<i>Sit down.</i>

2237
02:03:36,951 --> 02:03:38,161
The way Robin,

2238
02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:41,414
you know, interpreted that last moment
was all his-

2239
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:44,709
I think the only thing I said to him
was to resist the emotion.

2240
02:03:44,876 --> 02:03:48,671
I said, "There's a lot of emotion
in this room that you're coming into. "

2241
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:52,050
Because the boys were- I think
we'd shot all their side of it or whatever.

2242
02:03:52,216 --> 02:03:55,678
But they were whipped up anyway,
you know. They loved him.

2243
02:03:55,845 --> 02:04:00,099
Well, they love Robin.
There's not any other way to put it.

2244
02:04:00,266 --> 02:04:02,268
You know, they-

2245
02:04:02,435 --> 02:04:04,938
Both as the character and his-

2246
02:04:05,104 --> 02:04:08,107
Because of his generosity
during the shoot.

2247
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:13,029
And, you know, laughing
and talking to them and hanging out.

2248
02:04:13,196 --> 02:04:14,238
You know, he was-

2249
02:04:14,405 --> 02:04:18,409
Whether extras or the key actors.

2250
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:20,536
And he was funny, you know.

2251
02:04:21,746 --> 02:04:26,793
You do really admire somebody
who's funny when the humor is not cruel,

2252
02:04:26,959 --> 02:04:30,922
which Robin's isn't,
very unusual for that reason.

2253
02:04:31,547 --> 02:04:34,092
Anyway, so when Robin came in
to that classroom

2254
02:04:34,258 --> 02:04:37,970
for the quick rehearsal we did,
for a very low-key rehearsal-

2255
02:04:38,137 --> 02:04:42,558
Just hitched, you know, the marks,
the frame. And so then he did his takes.

2256
02:04:42,725 --> 02:04:45,728
And I just said to him, "You know,
just don't let the emotion affect you.

2257
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:49,649
That's the emotion on our movie set. "

2258
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:50,984
You know, in other words:

2259
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:53,569
"Let the audience be moved.
Don't you be moved. "

2260
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:59,200
You know,
"The less is more really from you. "

2261
02:04:59,367 --> 02:05:02,995
And he did it just perfectly.
I think that is—

2262
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:05,873
You know, I believed him.
That's all you can ask.

2263
02:05:06,082 --> 02:05:07,917
<i>Thank you, boys.</i>

2264
02:05:09,961 --> 02:05:11,379
<i>Thank you.</i>

2265
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:23,808
I think that I wrote,
"the close-ups of the boys, blackout. "

2266
02:05:23,975 --> 02:05:27,103
So each boy you'd see

2267
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:30,606
standing. It's pretty much like what it is.

2268
02:05:30,773 --> 02:05:33,526
And then, you know,
I have to mention the music here,

2269
02:05:33,693 --> 02:05:36,738
which I think Maurice Jarre
did a great job with.

2270
02:05:36,904 --> 02:05:41,868
This theme that just runs so
sort of subtly through the movie.

2271
02:05:42,034 --> 02:05:43,995
It just comes out here at the end.

2272
02:05:44,162 --> 02:05:48,916
For me anyway, it was very emotionally,
you know, charged.

2273
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,752
Peter also-

2274
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:52,170
I think the temp score-

2275
02:05:52,336 --> 02:05:54,881
<i>A lot of the temp score of the movie
was from The Mission,</i>

2276
02:05:55,048 --> 02:05:56,632
which I thought was a wonderful score.

2277
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:59,719
And I remember when I saw it
with the temp score,

2278
02:05:59,886 --> 02:06:01,262
I just thought, "Oh, my God.

2279
02:06:01,429 --> 02:06:05,141
We're never gonna be able to get
anything this good," you know.

2280
02:06:05,308 --> 02:06:07,894
And of course,
good old Maurice came through.

2281
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:10,104
But it was hard to-

2282
02:06:10,271 --> 02:06:13,191
When I first saw the film
without the temp score

2283
02:06:13,357 --> 02:06:15,902
to really adjust to Maurice's score.

2284
02:06:16,068 --> 02:06:18,571
But, boy, it really worked for me.

2285
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:21,449
Well, of course,
this presentation of the film

2286
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:23,993
is because of the brilliance
of the director.

2287
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:30,208
I mean, he knew exactly
what he wanted to put on film

2288
02:06:30,374 --> 02:06:34,253
in the visuals and in the performance.

2289
02:06:34,504 --> 02:06:36,589
It was very interesting

2290
02:06:36,756 --> 02:06:39,008
that as he went into postproduction,

2291
02:06:39,175 --> 02:06:41,928
as he got closer towards
finishing the final edit,

2292
02:06:42,095 --> 02:06:44,597
I rang to find out
how the film was going

2293
02:06:44,764 --> 02:06:47,809
and Peter said, "Well, it's going well. "
He said, "But we're a bit long. "

2294
02:06:47,975 --> 02:06:52,438
And he said, "I fear we're going to have
to cut it down a little bit. "

2295
02:06:52,605 --> 02:06:58,069
And I sort of said, "Well, what do you think
would have to go?"

2296
02:06:58,236 --> 02:07:02,115
And he said, "I think maybe the girl
might have to go, the girlfriend. "

2297
02:07:02,281 --> 02:07:03,658
He said, "But I don't want to.

2298
02:07:03,825 --> 02:07:08,621
I think she's a lovely little sort of catalyst
in there amongst the boys. "

2299
02:07:08,788 --> 02:07:10,456
And he said, "I don't wanna lose her. "

2300
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:15,294
When I finally, I think six weeks later,
flew over to do the release print timing,

2301
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:17,839
she was still in the movie.
There was nothing missing.

2302
02:07:18,005 --> 02:07:21,384
And I said to Peter, "How did you do it?
How did you get the film down to time?"

2303
02:07:21,551 --> 02:07:24,762
He said, "We just nipped away
at every shot.

2304
02:07:24,929 --> 02:07:27,723
Just went through the whole movie
and nip, nip, nip.

2305
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:31,352
Two frames here, eight frames there
and just slowly shortened,

2306
02:07:31,519 --> 02:07:36,190
tightened everything up in that entire
movie until it came down to length. "

2307
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:40,444
<i>I don't have a favorite scene
in the Dead Poets Society.</i>

2308
02:07:40,611 --> 02:07:42,530
But I do have faces.

2309
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:45,783
I do see the faces

2310
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:50,413
of the boys and of Robin
in certain moments and certain lights.

2311
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:53,624
You know, I see Charlie
on the telephone.

2312
02:07:53,791 --> 02:08:00,131
You know, and I see Neil
with his eyes blazing with excitement

2313
02:08:00,298 --> 02:08:03,217
for his part that he's got, you know?

2314
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:06,554
I see Todd and Robin in that-

2315
02:08:06,721 --> 02:08:10,308
Their faces where he's trying-
The poem is stumbling out

2316
02:08:10,474 --> 02:08:13,185
and Robin is urging him on.

2317
02:08:13,352 --> 02:08:18,149
And I think these are the things I recall
because these are the things I didn't do.

2318
02:08:18,357 --> 02:08:21,861
You know, these are things
that were surprises to me

2319
02:08:22,236 --> 02:08:27,366
and therefore that's what I recall,
and this is their work.
